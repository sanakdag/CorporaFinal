PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Shes an amazing professor She really lives up to the hype You have  papers that you have to submit before the end of the semester you work on drafts during the semester and your grade is also affected by weekly discussion posts not very timeconsuming at all as well as participation Fair grader you def have to put in work to get an A 
Class was in the summer the  hour block was hard to get through Grace is super nice but often seems disorganized with such a big time block for class Discussions were lively and entire class was always engaged Good atmosphere Grace is super nice and rewards you if you show effort One of the nicest professors at Tufts 
A very laid back and friendly professor Although most of the times unorganized and is sometimes not even sure herself what shes looking for in her students assignments Otherwise shes lenient on deadlines which is really nice when midterms and papers are all due around the same time

Prof Talusan is a kind caring professor who wants to see you succeed in writing I find writing difficult but her approach made writing much easier for me The way she structures her class no papers graded until the final exam period encourages you to make multiple revisions and meeting with her to discuss revisions is simple and beneficial 
Cant believe I paid so much tuition for such a pointless class 
i took her asian american love n sexuality class has a unique approach to writing exercises n focuses on students learning from and sharing experiences class discussions make time fly in class is also flexible w deadlines shes tufts alum 
This is the most compassionate professor I have ever had 
Taking English with her is almost a waste of time Her class discussions served no purpose She is very easy and friendly but she is probably one of the least organized professors at Tufts Classes are just chat sessions You cant really learn much from her 
Very lenient with deadlines always helpful and really compassionate about what she teaches

Assignments took no time at all and were usually very interesting She set up good discussions picked up on what topics students were more engaged in was very helpful and gave great support and feedback I left that class feeling more confident and prepared to write and I wish I could take her class again for English  Phenomenal professor 
She is a great teacher really kind and very go with the flow If you take English  with her its a great class almost no work and shes really laid back Take English with her if you want a blow off class that is very much bearable 
One of the best teachers ive had She is passionate about the material but open to all views and continually provoked some of the best class discussions An understanding reasonable person Her class inspired me to become an english major 
It wasnt until the end of the semester that I understood the goal of the class She is very unclear about assignments and each days readings is totally unrelated to the next The entire grade is based on the final essay and she was very helpful and met with me outside of class Overall I didnt really learn anything 
i was in her creative writing class and she really made me feel like i had a talent that was not yet recognized i was inspired to become an english major by the time the course finsihed she may not always be clear about assignments but the point of that class was getting creative she is very lenient with deadlines and gives good writing advice

LECTURE HEAVY 
Campbell is a really relatable and reasonable person and professor This helps make the science feel a little more accessible However lectures can sometimes be confusing so dont be afraid to speak up in class  she doesnt turn down questions or clarifications Can be a little difficult to reach by email but will respond to persistence 
SO MANY PAPERS 
Decent at explaining lab processes but totally vague in terms of what should actually go into the report so expect to tear your hair out over them 
SO MANY PAPERS 
HILARIOUS 
TOUGH GRADER 
Professor Campbell is knowledgeable She understands the material and wants to convey it However she did not manage Lab Lecture time well and we fell behind week  Expectations were unclear from the start and did not resolve the entirety of the semester Labs were interesting but poorly planned She tried to make herself accessible

she is honestly so sweet but after moving forward in the chem department ive realized she sort of makes problem sets and test questions harder than they have to be i think you can understand the concepts and still struggle a little bit shes there to help and shes really understanding

Horrible at replying to emails in a timely manner Poor use of lecture time most kids either skipped or just did other hw during class Tests were pretty chill if you study well She is really nice and always at her OH I just dont think chem was a good fit for her to teach since she didnt seem that into it 
The class is probably easier than Kryatov but she is a worse teacher She does not explain things very well or check for class understanding Class average was a  on the buffer test and was graded unfairly She is a super nice lady but I would not take her class Definitely do not take intro chem if you have AP credit 
Professor Campbell made me glad that Chem  was the last chem class Id need at Tufts Her lectures consist of her just reading off the slides at an incredibly slow pace and going off on useless tangents My knowledge of chemistry was much better leaving high school than after this class Practice exams also did not reflect the real exams

ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
Prof Campbell should stick to research clearly very knowledgable about Chemistry but poor teaching skills not clear or organized Her attitude is also poor and she never seems happy to be in the classroom HOWEVER the rest of the professors of Big Bang were awesome Take the course even to suffer through the Chemistry portion

After taking CHEM  with Campbell I never want to take another course in the chemistry department The professor simply reads through the slides at a horrible pace too Also do not rely on the practice exams they usually dont reflect the exams My biggest mistake at this school was taking a course with this professor

I am glad I never have to deal with intro chem Exams do not match practice material There is content on practices that have not been taught Unreliable in exam questions Overall a horrible class I should have stuck with Kryatov She doesnt actually teach anything and we didnt cover  of course content I wish Id never taken this course

She is pretty good at explaining concepts and preparing you for the lab DO NOT take the Monday lab section You will not get access to lecture slides and sometimes not even access to lab procedures until the day of your lab Also most of the labs get extended deadlines which you wont find out about until youve already finished the report 
Not good at explaining things Adds things to exams that were never covered Does not respond to emails and is very unorganized Would never take this class again ever

Professor Campbell is a nice person but I think she makes the tests more difficult than they need to be Like others said the test difficulty is difficult to predict usually nothing like the practice exams Im glad to be done with chem Tons of MasteringChem on top of exams lab reports and problem sets She is good about postponing deadlines 
Lab lectures are pretty decent although most of the time the concepts introduced have not been covered in PChem lecture yet so the lab reports take quite a while Professor Campbell is nice and will help out as best she can Quizes are okay Honestly this class depends way more on your lab TAs 
Professor Marrow is really great Her class was very interesting and she clearly knew her material very well and seemed very knowledgable In addition she is easily accessible and a great help At the end of taking her intro to soc class I ended up declaring a soc major and asking her to be my advisor All in all a terrific teacher

this class was a total mess for me theres about  readings of  dense pages each assigned for every class but she never does anything to check that you read them until the midterm rolls around basically only take SOC if youre both extremely interested in the subject material and extremely selfmotivated

Professor Cathelain is lazy From the first day everybody in the class could tell she had never prepped for a class before she enters with little idea of the questions she will ask and no lesson plan whatsoever Her feedback is vague and poor and when you go to office hours to ask she gives no additional help Stear clear

It was somewhat obvious that she had never taught a college class before and her lectures were highly unhelpful and she didnt really know how to structure topics so that we could understand them The powerpoints are highly unorganized and seem out of order I didnt use the textbook but I think that the textbook is probably the best study material

When going in to this class I didnt expect her to be hard but boy was I wrong I studied almost all day everyday and I went to her office hours but that didnt help She gives quizzes every week and says that they are based on the week before material But when you get the quizzes they have no correlation with the material 
Prof is very knowledgeable but lets students talk unchecked in class a little too much Class was generally interesting but there is far too much busywork that ends up overshadowing most genuine learning 
Cool subject topic but exams werent easy NOT an easy A 
Kind woman interested in her students and passionate about film and drama A little unclear with lectures though they dont always follow a clear order Intro to film is a good class not super easy but def not too hard 
Professor is very downtoearth She is interested in her students and wants to make sure that everyone does well However I did not learn as much as I thought I would Lectures dont say much to be honest but they are fun Good amount of discussion Read the textbook and you should do fine  the final was very textspecific when I took it

Shes really enthusiastic about the course and is really happy to help you at any point She gets some names wrong sometimes but she really does try to keep a really good atmosphere in the class Shes totally willing to answer any questions you have in class or in office hours if you ask Shes really sweet and obviously very happy to be teaching 
I love her She is so sweet and very helpful in office hours She is a pretty easy grader if you pay attention in class and do the homework and she encourages participation At first I was unimpressed but over time she really grew on me and helped me a lot 
CARING 
Prof Kelly really wants her students to succeed She tells you exactly what will be on the test and what to study which is really helpful because you need to study A lot Because while she wants her students to succeed she doesnt teach them You will be teaching yourself a lot of the materialSpends half the class trying to turn on the projector

Shes super nice but also a bit senile Goes on rants which you have to sit through Get ready for her long emails but she is very nice and will do anything and everything for her students 
Shes very sweet but not particularly great at actual teaching Generally doesnt notice whether or not the students understand 
Does she even know how to speak Spanish Be careful 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Professor Kelly is nice but doesnt really teach the class The class teaches grammar but students dont have opportunities to hold conversations in French and most of the learning comes straight from the textbook Also took her two months to learn my name in a fourteen person class Its an easy A but you need to work on your own to learn much

YSL is funny in class however she goes wayyy too fast and it is very difficult to keep up I also had bad experiences when approaching her during office hours which left me feeling worse about my learning after and made me regret taking the time to ask for help in the first place Love her personality but her teaching style isnt for everyone 
Pretty hard class but you definitely learn a lot She is one spicy pepper 
Prof Burtner is awesome She is extremely smart and sometimes her classes will seem like information dump in a good way but think about the out of class committments before taking this class Its not for everybody 
Awesome teacher really good at introducing the concept of Anthropology to everybody 
Prof Burnter is a wonderful teacher She is always on high speed but it makes for an interesting class She requires daily homework which is annoying but makes you do the reading and think about it Her classes are well organized even if her powerpoints could use some help I would highly recommend taking a class from her 
Professor Burtner is an incredible scholar professor mentor and human being Ive taken three classes with her and she is HANDS DOWN the best professor in Anthropology I still remember articles I read a year and a half ago because her teaching is so solid 
Professor Burtner is a great professor but also a great resource She is kindof hard to get ahold of becuase she is so involved outside of class and it can make her hard to follow sometimes in class but she is extremely willing to help you get involved outside of class if its your thing The workload is high but very interesting and useful 
Excellent professor Clear energetic and wellversed in her field Monica is a kind human being and will hopefully inspire you to study more philosophy beyond this class

Prof Spielberg was the best teacher I had at Tufts She really cares about students  is totally into the history  policy of public health  ethicsThe course should have been smaller but as a lecture it covered a lot There is A LOT of reading but so much is really interesting  worth it She knows a lot Heard she left though

I had some trouble understanding what she was looking for out of papers but by the end of the semester you get a pretty good feeling for what you need to write Go to office hours definitely theyre really helpful Some people in my class didnt do the readings and she goes into enough detail to do that but youll need the info for essays 
So yeah maybe shes a little wierd  sort of the classic cat lady and she talks about them all the time But her class isnt bad and she knows absolutely everything about the subject The work isnt all that difficult or demanding If you learn how to take effective notes from her lectures youll be fine on the exams with little studying 
she is a bit disorganized in her lectures but her classes arent that difficult the final project however can be a doozer Very time consuming

I had her for Probability and Statistics and she showed a clear lack of mastery of the material She makes many mistakes on the board and is often unable to answer any questions in class even when they directly relate to what shes teaching She is very nice but does not know how to lecture She sometimes says things that are just wrong in class 
Really nice pretty easy take notes and do the work 
Not a good lecturer cant keep her thoughts straight You never know if what shes writing on the board is what shes intending to say because both differ so often Incredibly frustrating Also told one class to change a question on the midterm then took points off for doing so

lectures are incredibly boring and shes hard to listen to But if you take down some notes and study a bit ull get a B without having worked hard at allat least thats what i did If you seek her out for help during office hours ull walk out more confused than when u walked in funny looking 
She goes off on wild tangents during class and your notes end up being incredibly incoherent and scrambled Its a shame too because she doesnt use the book at all except for homework The grading looks for certain wording so if you write a lot and cover as much material as you can youll do well Classes were boring but the work was easy enough 
This teacher was very great It mightve just been that Italian  was very easy for me but she was always cheerful and a pretty easy grader Tests werent that hard either 
I had to miss classes for a family emergency Prof Paolini offered to meet with me outside of her office hours to go over the material and then let me take the test later also not during her office hours because I couldnt go then She knows and sympathizes with the lifestyle of a college student Shes just so nice 
She was an awesome teacher Always went easy on you if you didnt know the answer when she called on you in class Graded tests fairly and didnt mind if you missed a few extra classes Always helpful if you needed to go to office hours WIsh all teachers were like her

I took genetics with her this summer and after she found her rhythm she turned out to be an excellent professor She is extremely engaging and willing to help Most importantly she is willing to admit when she is wrong and will listen to a students perspective in order to make the content clearer Also I cannot recommend office hours enough 
had her for both one and two and loved her definitely sticks to the book but thats a good thing for intro italian pretty lax about deadlines and things like that as long as assignments are eventually turned in if you need help definitely go to office hours though 
Shes a pretty sucky prof Shes barely audible in class and she doesnt teach all she does is go over exercises from the book Shes semi helpful in off hours but just try to avoid her  least for Ital  if you wanna learn 
had her for both italian  and  shes sweet but definitely not the best in the department you dont especially feel you are learning much just sort of cruising slowly through the course i felt a little underprepared when i got a new professor for italian  but shes ok ifyou push yourself because she wont really push you

A very boring class but very fair Her examples on blackboard are very clear and its not hard to do well if you study for the exams 
Interesting course Prof Loury occasionally had some very funny remarks Teaches the material well also 
By far the worst professor I have had at Tufts All she does is drop names She has a terribly frigid personality and is in general a pretty awful professor Never comes to her own office hours and always cuts class a few minutes short Terrible

Loury doesnt care much about her students progress Hard to reach and very cold personality Not a terribly hard class but not worth your time either

she works u hard and u learn a ton she wont let u be lazy because that is what a great teacher is she is funny and if u have difficulty go to office hours and shell go over it till u get it dont fall behind that would be suicide but if u stay on top of her class u can use what she teaches u for the rest of ur life as an alumni i would say she was one of my favorite teachers and i have very been so proud of a B it is hard and worth it susan is womderful 
Prof Russinoff is great She listens to students and does her best to help those who have trouble with Logic She loves the course and the material and writes fair tests DO THE HOMEWORK READ THE BOOK GO TO CLASS HAVE FUN

Russinoff is great Definitely cares a lot and is super helpful highly recommend taking her if possible 
One of the best professors I have had at Tufts She has a great sense of humor and keeps you engaged and focused on what could be a very boring topic Tests are fair The weekly problem sets take a while but very doable Russinoff is amazing  dont know what else to say 
I learned a lot in this course The professor really cares about the students understanding the material Highly recommended Challenging but fun course Go to class and do the work 
I tried to take this for a math requirement but i dropped it after  weeks because it was impossible and the homework made me cry and im actually pretty smart maybe i should have given it a chance and the prof seemed cool but it was just HARD 
smart but needs to get over herself

TEST HEAVY 
Her lectures are way more helpful than the book especially for PL She really wants you to succeed Sometimes she can be a bit condescending and her tests are only  questions and very important so  wrong could get you a B or C on the test She is forgiving if you have one bad test grade though Overall really funny caring and smart 
Great professor mothered the whole class through a touch subject with an abundance of dry humor Engaging which is an accomplishment in the interesting but bonedry Philosophy of Logic Take this to get a math credit out of the way 
Shell help you in office hours but her lectures were a bit confusing It is a hard class Not an easy way out of the math requirement youre better off in math  or finite math both are pretty much high school algebra from what ive heard 
Although she was a great professor this class is terrible if you know anything about Discrete math If youre taking this class for an easy math credit fine but if you are a mathoriented person dear god stay away Its phenomenally boring despite the profs great enthusiasm and teaching

Russinoff is amazing Anyone who can make a dry topic like Logic fun and interesting is an excellent teacher She gives really clear examples while teaching and jokes around a lot with her students Some concepts are difficult to understand but she will ALWAYS meet with you outside of class to make sure you get it 
Always looks decent If you cant understand her just stare Very slow lecturer

Professor Russinoff is so wonderfully sassy Logic class with her is a lot of fun even though its pretty difficult Everyone does badly on the exams so dont freak out 
I loved this course and the professor somehow makes logic fun and interesting It was hard but I learned a lot 
Pretty dry subject matter but not the worst class you can take for your math credit or philosophy requirement Russinoff is a great professor and always does her best to keep things interesting Shell talk about her own life sometimes though but its always really cute so it doesnt bother me Shes so hot too 
hard class but good teacher 
Highly HIGHLY recommended Wonderful professor who is incredibly accessible  email her and shell email you back almost instantly Easy and straightforward class easy A Very interesting course lets the students change the direction of the course based on interest Useful skills Take it for a fun credit 
Not what I expected and not the most incredible teacher Ive had She really does need to get over herslf If youre taking it just to fill the math requirement think twice I have some friends that took it for that reason and they regret it 
Shes great We had a fun class She talked about Martha Stewart a lot Has a calico cat by the name Charlotte

Great professor very enthusiastic and knows her stuff Not an easy class but you can do well if you work hard 
shes hot she talks about martha stewart and this is an easy way out of math requirement unless youre an idiot 
I never thought Id say this even less did I think such a thing possible but the lectures actually have an adverse effect on your ability to grasp logic She does a fabulous job making the relatively simple material appear complex TAs were phenomenal though Russinoff is totally incapable of grabbing either the respect or attention of students 
Very helpful and sweet Make sure to participate and shell definitely give you other perspectives to consider 
Russinoff is awesome She really does make the material clear and understandable although it is hard If you cant handle it thoughwell maybe you should think twice about calling yourself quotsmartquot Go to class pay attention read the book do the hw and it should be a positive experience for you 
Hard grader but really wants you to focus on learning and the writing process Not an easy A but will work with you to rewrite your papers until you receive a good grade Interesting teacher awesome person

Professor Russinoff is awesome She is funny and though logic is a big class you can get to know her if you take the initiative The tests are difficult but the class gets easier late in the semester as most of the material is cumulative 
I loved Phil with this professor She was a great teacher and really fair We had the chance to rewrite all our papers Sounds like someone was really unhappy with a grade 
Russinoff is a fabulous instructor She has an incredible charisma which makes dry material interesting Logic is by no means easy but she is precise and clear in her lectures and makes herself readily available to students who need help Do the problem sets go to class and dont be afraid to approach her She makes lectures a joy to attend

people come to fill major requirements or get out of math but they stay for professor russinoff She is funny charming and also very caring  I came to her office panicking one day and since then whenever i see her she always greets me by name and asks me how im doing shes also good at explaining difficult material and always available

I absolutely LOVE professor Russinoff She is the most caring teacher at Tufts She is so intelligent and funny and will really go the extra mile for you Really a must take at Tufts I have taken her for ethics bowl every year and her philosophy for children class 
good teacher and good class she makes hard material understandable 
She seems mean and sarcastic at first but actually turns out to be really awesome Go to office hours she will explain it until you get it and is nice about it Class is great but definitely not easy unless you are a math major 
I agree with the comments about this class except I wouldnt say its an easy A I worked in this class and learned a lot Great teacher Fun class 
Best professor Ive had at Tufts so far Funny and an excellent teacher The class isnt easy but it isnt impossible either 
Wonderful class Prof Russinoff keeps things entertaining did you know that love is not a symmetric relation and explains things very clearly Not easy but if you read the book do the problem sets go to class and ask questions you should be fine Math skills are a huge help 
I found this class to be pretty easy Prof Russinoff is very clear and the textbook lays out the material well The TAs are also fantastic and a large portion of the grade is problem sets making getting an A very possible 
She is so nice So awesome So funny 
fun class 
Russinoff is amazing Probably the best professor Ive had thus far She makes logic as clear as it could possibly be and is very accessible Shes also hilarious and made me want to come to class even on a Friday 
This is a really useful course and its fun Not too hard The professor is helpful and really knows this stuff It helps you reason better and is useful in your other courses 
Great teacher she is very intelligent and knows what she is talking about 
AWESOME professor her enthusiasm brings lively energy to the class she is passionate fun has interesting assignments and knows how to teach TAKE THIS CLASS 
she is a very good professor i learned a lot from her 
Great teacher 
fantastic professor who clearly knows what she is teaching and her classes are interesting and well planned out she has a great sense of humor too 
Deceptively difficult class Tests ask for details from littlediscussed readings Class becomes repetitive very quickly Prof Balbach is engaging but subject isnt stimulating 
Balbachs an amazing lecturer very engaging and funny No textbooks for this class just  novels and you have to read them to do well on the tests but theyre interesting books 
Balbach is an incredible teacher Any class she teaches is gold She is funny engaging and very passionate about community health Going to her lectures was a treat 
Fantastic Professor genuinely nice person great advisor REALLY cares about students and subject 
She is a wonderful professor and is really passionate about what she is teaching 
awesome great teacher great class shes really passionate about what shes teaching and you can learn so much in this class 
She is very smart and she communicates well I learned a lot in the course and I really enjoyed it 
She gives an interesting lecture Workload is relatively light Papers are fun to write but I thought that the exams didnt cover the course material well 
Balbach is great but not as clear as I expected her to be she seemed to have clear moments where she lost track of what she was saying The class itself is peculiar you mostly learn paradigms rather than concrete material so some people can get frustrated She is funny and a genuinely kind person she is the reason for the CH depts success 
Its wonderful take it 
Wonderful class Professor Balbach teaches in an clear manner making sure everyone understands before moving on to the next topic She manages to be funny and engaging despite the size of the class She is always willing to chat after class or during her office hours While the material is not too hard many of the assignment are graded toughly 
HYSTERICAL Clear Good workloadinteresting readings Engaging in recitations Not the clearest exams but most people do comparably Also dont agree with how she grades papers but that is a biased opinion Nevertheless she is great and one of my favorite Tufts teachers thus far 
Very difficult class  deceptively difficult Tests ask for very specific details do not concentrate on main topics Even if you know the concepts well if you dont know specific details from readings expect a C or F Tests are only about  open ended questions Material is relatively boring although readings can be interesting 
Balbach gives good lectures but I found the subject to be extremely repetitive Recitations were also dull and my TA did not try to engage us at all She did not seem to care Its not impossible to do well in the class but I think it takes selfmotivation and genuine interest Unfortunately I lost both less than halfway through the course 
Amazing lecturer You will not be bored in class Very animated very funny and subject of discussion is usually interesting Tests are in depth study for them and make sure you know the details  tests Papers can be challenging but between TAs and mandatory writing help there are plenty of sources for aid  papers total  pgs 
Prof Balbach is a great professor Very very likable The readings were really interesting too Exams were poorly designed as a wholewere far too nitpicky on details The essays were a little meh Recitation attendance is mandatory But she was a fantastic professor and lecturer you just have to take her to see it 
Awesome professor Shes a really engaging lecturer I never fell asleep or got bored in her class 
She has a great sense of humor and is ridiculously helpful especially in her office hours 
She and her guest lectures were interesting The paper assignments were perfect for the class discussions But beware of the teststhe material that she stresses over and over again in class is not the material that appears on the exam instead she pulls random examples out of the readings and expects you to have remembered every minute detail 
Very FAIR professor Work hard understand what is taught and you will do well She will do everything she can to help you understand the material Pay particular attention to concepts she seems to mention over and over again 
I entered the class with more interest than I left with Shes funny but not very nice The exams were too long Some material was interesting but most was just boring and redundant Amanda was a great TA though 
ery approachable professor makes an effort to know your name at office hours She does a great job at explaining concepts to the class Very nice professor and funny made the class enjoyable and students wanted to attend lecture was nearly full every day Grading in the class can be a bit harsher than expected but reading load was light 
Disappointing class Prof Balbach is clearly experienced and engaged but the material is less than stimulating Class becomes repetitive and assignments are vague Tests pull material from obscure readings and ask for detail It is a deceptively difficult class

She is the most boring lecturer I have had at Tufts by far She talks very quietly and is hard to understand because she mumbles Not engaging at all and assigns way too much textbook reading and the midterm essays and final are based on this reading I wouldnt recommend this class to anyone 
worst class I have ever taken Im warning you  if at all possible take another class to satisfy your world civ requirement this class is boring and painful to sit through professor manz knows a ton but she is the most boring teacher you can imagine 
Prof Manz is clearly very knowledgeable about nearly everything concerning the Middle East but for some reason decided to focus on the least interesting and most dense material Shes always available outside of class and very helpful but the material is tough and not always worth while 
Professor Manz is really nice knows her stuff and is generally a fair grader For History of Iran she devoted half a class per week to group discussion which helped the class get to know each other and was a nice break from lecture which can be rather dry Exams were short takehome essays and there was a page original research paper too

Professor Manz is a treasure of the Tufts History department 
She runs a tough class but par for the course for history Tests and papers are fair and material is interesting 
She is a rough professor but a fair grader All exams are take home and generally analytical essays Shell help you and give you advice but its still pretty hard VERY INTELLIGENT INTERESTING WOMAN Hard hard class 
Her lectures are flawless and engaging She is brilliant but not egocentric which makes her so likeable She wants students to succeed so she doesnt throw any curveballs Theres a fair amount of readings but they all relate to the inclass discussions Engagement is key Take a class with her Youll be glad you did 
Prof Pott is a great lecturer and tries to keep her class engaging You will receive more specific help from the TAs during recitation but Pott is the true backbone of the class If you have questions ask early Class is manageable if you stay on top of reading 
Martha is the woman At first she may seem kind of hippydippy but she knows her and she is incredibly caring and dedicated to students I had something nightmarish happen to me in the place I was working and she was truly there for me gave me advice and support and offered to go to bat for me and she wasnt even my internship advisor 
Martha Pott is one of the most dedicated professors in the Eliot Pearson Department anyone that says otherwise is a bad student If you miss her course it is your loss 
unfair 
Great professor Such a kind lovely woman who truly cares about her students progress If you worked hard enough in CD  you did well  it was simple I suggest getting to know Dr Pott she is approachable and extremely helpful if you need advice about an internship or other academic endeavor Great class

Pretty difficult concepts in general Lectures are very complicated but if you ask for help and go to office hours shes very receptive Tests are way less daunting than the lectures make them seem I found her a better professor than others seem to on here 
She has a strong russian accent However this class is easy  quizzes To do well memorize the powerpoints  midterms no final multiple choice free response and problems The problems are the EXACT problems from the book with different numbers The rest memorize the notes Easy And I dont even understand Econ generally 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
EXTRA CREDIT 
She is not an organized professor and her lecture slides arent useful at all Her lectures are boring and what she talks about in class is not on the test The tests are very problem based She is always available for office hours and will give you ways of increasing your grade She curves the grades so its fairly easy to get a good grade 
Shes terrible Tough to understand partially because of her accent and partially because shes just the worst With that said its not too difficult Read the book and memorize the examples in it because she pulls a lot of her tests psets from it 
Professor cant seem to organize her own thoughts and material during lecture and often makes mistakes to her own examples some of which she cant solve Exams are haphazardly planned and usually include questions that are not covered in class so a lot of self reading is required 
EXTRA CREDIT 
perhaps one of the easiest econ courses ive taken while at tufts Gnedenko is also a great professor and very clear in her teaching Overall   easy comprehensive and engaging 
Ec  is somewhat challenging and one would benefit from taking linear algebra beforehand or at the same time Katya is very sweet and helpful in office hours though she can get derailed in class because the content gets complicated fast She has all materials wellorganized online so what you dont understand in class can be fixed via selfstudy 
Not a very good teacher Going to class is only useful to get her lecture notes but she posts those online later anyways Study from the problem sets Her tests are pretty straightforward You wont learn very much in her class but its easy to get a pretty good grade 
TOUGH GRADER 
Where to start Ekaterina is one of the most frustratingly horrible professors I have ever had She makes mistakes on everything from the solutions of problems to wording questions incorrectly on tests to concocting quizzes that cant possibly be finished in the allotted time Bc of all this u can work hard and have nothing to show for it 
The lectures can be incredibly confusing and frustrating but reviewing the slides outside of class is actually helpful A lot of her examples are taken straight from the textbook so using the book is really helpful Shes a lenient grader however and very willing to help although not shes always as helpful as she thinks she is 
ok first of all Im really interested in this subject because Id like to become a environmental scientist that aside this is a really interesting class the prof really knows her stuff class is not too hard some exam questions were tough  you can learn a lot if you participate in the class do hw study course material 
Shes super nice but not the best lecturer Easy class though 
Unbelievably bad professor Never understands the questions so never successfully answers a questions This is NOT the level of education we should be receiving at Tufts 
Not the best lecturer She can be really confusing about the material and does not always explain things clearly Form study groups to help each other out If youre a quant econ major you just have to push through She is a caring professor and is accessible in office hours 
She will only give you an A if the essay blows her mind away It is really hard to get an A She doesnt look at essays beforehand to help you out Shes funny but its a hard class

TOUGH GRADER 
GET READY TO READ 
I never went to class past the first few weeks I really didnt feel bad though as the book was a far better teacher than she could possibly hope to be You are better off taking a class another time than wasting said time learning incomprehensible proofs that the textbook does better Perhaps in less abstract classes she is better 
Her accent DOES NOT get in the way of her teaching If anything its cute She may not be the most interesting teacher but she writes everything on the board goes over lots of hw problems and is very clear I would recommend taking Math  with Glaser though if you can Glaser rules 
Absolutely horrible Do yourself a favor and dont take any class in which she is a teacher 
This is the easiest and clearest teacher in the whole University Shes my counselor and she really helped me make the right course choices 
Her homework grading system is dysfunctional for one problem your possible scores are  and  and she takes too long on easy parts of proofs while going over hard parts very quickly Usually she was clear enough in lecture though I enjoyed the course the extra credit assignment near the end of the course probably made me happier about it 
Her accent is cute 
She is patient but does not cover everything needed for home works and tests The harder parts are addressed hazily sometimes because of the time Usually not in office during office hour And really I rely on textbook to pass the course 
Its math Pay attention once in a while and something may penetrate your thick skulls Youll be able to use your math skills to make sure the guy whos buying the newspaper from you isnt stiffing you 
I actually switched sections because of the horrible teaching I suggest avoidance at all costs 
In general I had great experiences with the math department I hear she is good with the lower level classes but she made a potentially interesting subject dull and impossible I still aced the class but with no help from her I suspect that there was a huge curve considering how uninvolved the class was 
I couldnt tell whether she was boring or it was just the material Asks extremely simple questions and spends a lot of time on very simple concepts 
TOUGH GRADER 
Strict to attendance even though the syllabus does not require attendance at all Once you miss a lecture she will be kind of cruel to you 
She is good for the lower classes but is very sloppy for the upperlevel ones She also comes off as very uncaring during office hours acting as though she cant deal with your question and why are you making her waste her time on it She is blunt and I find it rude at times If she doesnt want to teach then she should stop

Calc III is hard and Montserrat wasnt helping She spends lots of time on the easy bits and glosses over the hard material Quite boring Take a different prof if you can 
HILARIOUS 
INSPIRATIONAL 
Montserrat isnt great but calc  is doable in her class if you study outside of it and rely on your TA 
Incomprehensible 
She has a surprising sense of humor Her lectures were usually clear but she doesnt make an effort to find out what math classes everyone has taken and sometimes assumes that you know things that you have never learned 
She does not teach her voice is impossible to follow not helpful after class doesnt speak english DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER If you do youll see what i mean and drop it 
CARING 
While her accent can make it difficult to understand at some times Montserrat is the best math professor Ive had so far She explains the material clearly and methodically always having enough time to go over homework questions and get through all the material for the day I entered every test feeling completely prepared thanks to her teaching

Professor Shaw has an impressive background in what she teaches However her lectures are erratic and class discussion is pretty terrible She isnt very clear in what she wants in the work you turn in either Overall she isnt very articulate which throws off the lectures 
even though am a rel maj this was a terrible class borring one midterm final paper all usual reading 
Lectures were slow and boring often interceded with unhelpful group discussions She takes a long time to process and share ideas however she is clearly knowledgeable She is very kind and does encourage group participation however classes are slow and filled with awkward pauses 
Professor Shaw is very nice but overall a pretty useless professor Her lectures are mediocre and most of the class is wasted on group discussion that is unhelpful and uninteresting Furthermore she is extremely unclear about assignments and grades arbitrarily and unfairly 
Professor Shaw is an accomplished scholar in her field but this does not translate well into her teaching The curriculum was interesting but very reading intensive   page books More importantly she was not adequately able to use the text efficiently to convey the concepts of anthropology lens ethnography conflictreconciliation 
Very intelligent could use some work on teaching 
Professor Shaw is very nice and its clear that she is very knowledgeable in her field However her class had little structure or clarity Her TA appeared to do most of the work and lectures were erratic and sometimes dysfunctional The material was interesting but she did little to make it engaging Half the time she didnt show up 
She is an excellent professor and made this class extremely engaging and wellstructured I was never bored and always felt my comments were encouraged and appreciated She really listens to students comments and offers constructive and thoughtful feedback Anyone interested in Africa and postconflict development should take this class 
Shin is an intelligent detailed lecturer She takes the time to go in depth into topics so that her students are more interested in the material and are therefore more likely to pay attention to  understand it 
She is extremely intelligent and intimidating You will work very hard but learn a lot She answers her emails with lightning speed and is always very helpful We had a LOT of reading and homework in this course an intense exam and a pg paper Take this class if you love abnormal psych and can handle some biology Hard but worth it 
Intimidating not enthusiastic Class was dry and boring She answers email questions quickly but can be rude and impatient in person dont bother reading the textbook 
I loved the class but I had a problem with Professor Shins behavior She has a habit of repeatedly checking her cell phone during class which I thought was really annoying We made presentations near the end of the course and I saw her texting during a few of them She even did it once when I was talking to her during the break in the middle 
Clear lectures Keeps it interesting by showing videos to reiterate points

bad french teacher i came into the class with zero french background and ended up having to do most of the grammar work on my own she spent  of the class playing pointless games describing celebrities in french and hardly explained any grammar incomprenhensible in class and her chicken scratch handwriting further complicates things 
Shes really ADD about teaching she jumps around from subject to subject and doesnt fully explain anything 
Professor Ho is great Shes very supportive and always gave us great vocab to help us learn beyond the book Shes such a wonderful person 
Very confusing unclear nothing is organized or structured whatsoever 
Very unclear She has the worst handwritting ever which makes it impossible to understand what she is writing A fast paced class that requires a lot of your own time in order to actually learn the material If you are good at learning things by yourself then you will do fine in the class Relying on her will guarantee that you fail She is very anal about attendance 
If you would like a professor who doesnt explain the material well who is difficult to understand who doesnt follow the syllabus and skips around frequently who gives incomprehensible handouts and who shares your grades with the entire class take French with professor Ho 
The class is a bit overwhelming at first but you get used to her unique style of teaching and it really isnt that bad She is open to suggestions regarding how she teaches the class and will even ask you how you like to learn sometimes She also has her funny moments that keeps everyone in the class laughing even if she doesnt realize it 
Prof Ho was wonderful She really cared about her students and was clearly very passionate about teaching French I would absolutely recommend her to anyone interested in learning French 
She is an extremely nice woman but goodness gracious is she difficult to follow during class She tends to gloss over misunderstandings or confusions with Just accept it instead of explaining why things are Also she normally does not write out sentences in full on the board which leaves your own notes incomplete and difficult study from 
I took French  with Prof Ho She was a great teacher always giving us extra vocabulary outside of the textbook At the end of the semester she gave us alla list of useful words and phrases we might ever need It was so sweet and thoughtful of her She took great care to make sure everyone learned the material well Great teacher great class

Laney is super compassionate and approachable The homework can be oppressive sometimes so DONT procrastinate I learned a LOT though I often found her lectures to be confusing when I didnt read the textbook beforehand Do the reading and do your homework and youll be more than fine The extra credit is nice to have but not necessary for an A 
Genster is the worst professor Ive ever had She assigns too much reading to cover in class No idea about the relevance or work load in relation to her students More concerned with her disjointed ideas then students understanding and comprehension of material She is an awful lecturer  ruined English lit for me 
So scattered She goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the topic Assignes waay too much reading and then does not even cover half of it adequately in class Do not take her class 
enthusiastic lecturer but quite boring and dry 
Heres the thing about this class Its absurd to expect any teacher to condense all of this material into one semesters worth of reading And I appreciate JGs effort but theres so much material and so little of it is actually discussed in class that I learned almost nothing from discussions She is also a tough grader which isnt fun 
She is really nice but this class is all over the place Since it covers such a broad timespan the reading load is ridiculous However its easy to sit in class without having done the reading because theres no time to discuss everything indepth 
Professor Genster tackles a difficult task a survey course which hopes to cover more material than possible in an energetic and enthusiastic manner She truly cares about her students and their progress and is incredibly available to her students at all hours She makes time for individual meetings and greatly encourages class participation 
She was really upbeat and good at promoting discussion albeit a little scattered I can see how she would not do well teaching a large class but for this small class of  she did quite well 
there actually isnt that much reading relative to most lit courses genster moves fast but thats the nature of a survey some have accused her of being hard to understand I disagree despite this shes always been available for help or explanation 
I tried to like Julia Genster She clearly is interested in what she teaches unfortunately this does nothing to make up for her just not being a very good teacher She is highly ineffective extremely scattered and while she has some interesting insights she fails to share them in a cogent manner I would never take a class with her again 
Wow She seriously has some serious problems staying focused She goes off on way too many tangents and has really complex ideas that she has trouble communicating The reading is also just too much Nonetheless shes a nice woman and she tries 
shes all over the placeher high pitched voice alone make you dread going to classvery enthusiastic but on another planetpretty boring not the worst ever 
The WORST professor Ive had in the English Department She is extremely disorganized and seems physically incapable of expressing herself clearlythe archetype for the jumbled spacey professor who you cant learn from Impossibly high standards for papers but if you go to her office hours maybe shell like you a little 
Horrible professor scatterbrained  very difficult to understand 
She was very unorganized She grades hard but is willing to help you work on essays and things 
Shes a bit scattered yes but highly intelligent and assertive in her views Has interesting insights and lively if not manic extemporaneous sideshows She is a great and entertaining instructor if you are only willing to go along with the ride 
soooooo very average the class is a ton of reading naturally and mostly boring shes fine just kind of flighty 
She is interesting and really passionate about the subject When it comes to essays she is a tough grader If you like the subject take the class The discussions in class were usually fun 
This was a very hard dry class its something you have to do for an english major but dont get your hopes up hard grader more reading than you can imagine very hard quizzes finals a killer Good luck 
shes brilliant and hilarious shes not very organized about lecturing but that doesnt matter too much because her classes are primarily discussionbased 
TOUGH GRADER

Her Intro to Shakespeare class was actually so bad that it made me a prospective English minor never want to take another English class again No clear grading criteria no sense of what mattered and what didnt Lectures were worthless I wouldve gotten just as much out of reading Shakespeare on my own 
She may be a tough grader but Genster is THE Shes insanely witty and kind of insane but in a good way entertaining and sharp as a tack Its unbelievable how wellrounded this English professor is She once lectured a bit on Newtonian physics 
No grasp on the capabilities of her students Does not cover ANY of the readings effectively Avoid General View of English Lit like the plague 
Shes all over the place I totally cant understand what shes talking about The reading is abundant and not very interesting 
Professor Genster is hilarious She may be a little scattered but if youre able to keep up its a great class The reading is a lot and she does grade pretty hard but its worth it if youre willing to put in the effort 
SO disorganized scattered and confusing She never has time to cover even half of the material she assigns and there is no method to her analysis Shes all over the place and she ruins good books by poorly discussing them Terrible stressful class Do not recommend 
This was a difficult course and went very quickly through lots of info but shes a pretty decent teacher I enjoyed the classes

Remedios is really nice but she might be better off as a middle school teacher with her style She leads you to the answer a bit too much in a way that is too childish at times We are college students and we have the ability to understand a theoryconcept without a massive build up Here tests were specific with memorizing useless numbers 
I really liked taking PSY  with Prof Remedios I didnt find the lectures dull like the other reviewers here did The information was presented in a crystal clear format that I found very easy to learn There was also a good bit of class interaction and some inclass exercises The tests were also not too difficult 
LECTURE HEAVY 
GET READY TO READ 
Her lectures were interesting She goes over the material very well and gets you to remember it The class has lots of reading not all of which is covered in lecture sometimes Pay attention to specific examples and studies mentioned in lectures as they may show up on a test 
Very clear and straightforward professor Her lectures are wellorganized and she will gladly help during office hours Social Psychology was a great class with her 
Remedios basically recites off the Powerpoint presentations as her lectures making material that should be very interesting into something that is extraordinarily dull The material was not actually that difficult but her test questions were ambiguous and confusing and the short answers were left too much to the TAs discretion 
I really enjoyed Psy  with Prof Remedios The information was presented in very clear and effective ways she often used pop culture references and in class experiments to supplement material She was really great about answering questions in class The class is easy as long as you pay attention to lectures and review the textbook 
Took social psychology Classes were really boring and everything we learned was selfexplanatory That being said class averages was lower than the material difficulty because test multiple choice questions were ambiguous and the material is so boring that most people dont study 
The most boring class Ive ever taken at Tufts Remedios lectures were almost exact recitations of the textbook and extremely dry not to mention almost all of the material is selfexplanatory In addition tests were ambiguous and divergent from lectures

You shouldnt take this class with her She is boring although helpful during office hours Dont take social psychology with her because you will lose interest 
Souhads intro to levantine class was awesome  even though it was early in the morning Dragging yourself out of bed for her class is well worth the struggle She is a great teacher and being a native Palestinian knows all kinds of funny expressions and teaches with songs and videos and cartoons She is super and often brings food for us to class 
Souhad is the best Shes funny helpful and effective in her teaching Its hard not to like her She makes learning Arabic fun 
Suhad is the best Shes funny approachable and helpful Take Arabic with her and you wont regret it

EMILY KING IS AMAZING I had her for Freshman Writing Seminar Love and Sexuality She cares SO much about the subject and about her students Once she didnt have time to meet with me to go over a paper so she called me on the phone and we talked about it then She is so clear and very encouraging I want her to give me life advice hahaha 
Very fluent in english has an accent but it is minor She is a clear and good teacher not the most interesting but still interesting Good for early chinese 
By far the best Chinese teacher Ive ever had and Ive had quite a few Shes very clear very caring and really makes you use the language She actually knows how to teach and explain Chinese grammar Class is usually fun and interesting and Im amazed at how much Ive learned 
Good teacher but a little on the passive aggressive side The kind of teacher who is likely to purposely call on you when youre not paying attention 
Some people dislike her but i found her to be incredibly helpful clear and always ready to meet outside of class far better than anyone i had in high school if you get on her good side early on by going to office hoursparticipating frequently she will make sure you do well 
Kosinski is the best She has high expectations but is scrupulously fair Assignments are always clear Plus shes always ready to meet with students and is really helpful when you go see her She genuinely cares about her students progress and it shows Lecture is always engaging and she goes out of her way to cover topics students request 
she wasnt a very good presenter class was not at all what it was supposed to be tests were a lot harder than they needed to be DEFINITELY do NOT recommend taking this class 
Seeing previous views only confirms my belief that a lot of reviews on this site are ridiculous She is one of the most accessible and helpful professors I have ever had Her class is not the easiest but she makes her expectations very clear you definitely know what you have to do to get a good grade What you put in is what you get out

Professor Kosinski is passionate about the topic of disease control and makes this class her own She caters to students requests and teaches the class in a very democratic way There are weekly quizzes and you are expected to do thorough readings before each class and participation is an essential part of the class I recommend this class 
The professor grades on format more than content while making format expectations unclear She is available outside class but is so unclear about expectations within papers and assignments as to make getting a fair grade impossible I should have listened to former students about not taking her class

Linda Garant is the best math teacher Ive ever had Ive always had a hard time with teachers explanations and hers were perfect She understood students questions and would offer alternate explanations The exams were hard but if if you do all the homeworks and studied youll do fine Linda is the best teacher for Math  so try to get her 
Professor Garant is the best math teacher I have ever had I learned more in this course than in  high school math courses She really cares about her students and their learning style Great experience I would take another class with her in a heartbeat 
Linda is a fabulous professor The class is very clear and easy to follow shes extremely helpful and shes so positive and upbeat that she makes it fun She struck a good balance between teaching the kids who had never taken calculus before and the kids who already knew most of the material 
She is the best math teacher I have ever had in my life Made concepts so easy to understand very clear knew everyones name after first week of class willing to help out with ANYTHING pretty much anytime If youre going to take math  or  do it with her 
While I had no interest in taking Math  Linda Garant was extremely helpful and kind Her lectures are clear but very fast paced However she will happily slow down if questions are asked Work daily homework  exams 
She is very nice and very good at explaining the math and she is especially good at answering peoples questions She is a very caring lady and when someone would let her know that they had to for example leave class early she would respond with Just do what you gotta do Great lady Made me like math more 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Professor Garant is very sweet and approachable She has a unique style of teaching where shell post the lectures for us to watch outside of class and have us do practice problems during class I found the recommended textbook and homework problems to be unnecessary Watch the lectures take detailed notes and go to class and youll do fine 
Good teacher definetely better than most other professors in the department she was never fast enough to finish everything in class and was a bit lazy to do the whole HW problems on the board but she was pretty clear on her explanations 
A fantastic math teacher 
She never made her grading policy clear never addressed any questions I emailed her about overall just a complete disappointment 
Professor Garant is absolutely incredible She makes the material crystal clear and if for any reason you cant follow her instruction she will stop everything until you understand Shes kind occasionally really funny and just an overall wonderful professor Cant recommend her highly enough 
A gift from the math gods Linda is an incredible professor I hate math and I was able to understand and succeed in her class She cares so much about her students and she is always available to help She has a way of explaining math unlike any teacher I have ever had She is the one you want at the blackboard I cant speak more highly of her

Prof Garant made me actually care about anything mathematical She doesnt stop until each student understands it if they want to understand it Always available in office hours and for special appointments Shes a redeeming gem of Tufts math dept 
Linda is a great teacher who truly cares about her students and is passionate about the subject There were quizzes every class but theyre not particularly difficult and the major tests were fair Not the most interesting topic but for a math credit its not too bad 
Linda is undoubtedly the best teacher I have ever had and probably the best teacher I will ever have She is so patient caring and understanding I took two courses with her in the same semester and she continuously went out of her way to make time to meet with me I cant say enough about how remarkable she is She is a gift from the math gods

Homelessness in America was so fun Basically a seminar with a lot of participation and different activities every week We were encouraged to volunteer in the homeless community and attend events like public forums on affordable housing No inclass exams just midterm papers and a final project She is so passionate that it is infectious 
Honestly this is what every professor should be like What she cares about the most is that her students are doing as well as they can I literally could not get ahold of a textbook until right before a midterm and she actually gave me a book and an extension she is absolutely wonderful and really represents what all teachers should be more like 
Attendance is not mandatory but participation is She truly has a desire to allow class discussion to come from the students All her classes consist of small writings usually in response to readings a couple mid size papers and one long one The readings will always be complex but she answers questions well in class and thrives on discussion

Professor Lemons is very kind and caring She is super helpful in office hours oneonone but sitting in class during facilitation was like pulling teeth She was super disorganized often seemed confused and did not engage the class effectively I am disappointed because I like her a lot as a person but she is not a good teacher 
This was a pretty easy class if you did the readings but a lame professor Her biases show through pretty clearly and she didnt say anything when students made derogitory comments about nontraditional religions in her class 
Professor Lemons leads a great class The class is discussionbased so youre going to be doing a lot of talking on an individualsmall group level but she really tries hard to make sure that everyone is understanding the material A lot of reading but I learned more than I did in other Tufts classes 
Good class much better than CR  Long readings but well explained if the class asks questions She likes discussions Three papers and some smaller things like discussion leadership I enjoyed it 
no way 
I LOVE HER 
interesting class 
Not the most aggressive teacher so discussion needs to be motivated by the class Lots of reading but most of it is worthwhile NOT biased giving equal time to all views but does not put up with derogatory remarks of any kind pro or antireligion 
really boring she tries really hard but just cant keep my interest readings are really hard for nonphilosophy people like myself 
She is not good at keeping a class together so the class discussions dont really lead anywhere However outside of class she is incredibly helpful and will tend to grade more leniently if you show that you care about your grade it certainly helped me Wellmeaning and nice if youre interested in her class by all means visit her office

Awesome professor great at lectures If you pay attention in class and do all the homework out youll do well on the exams 
one of the best professors ive had she makes it so easy to understand the material while other students in other classes struggle with the same material 
Im VERY bad at math so I shouldnt have taken this as my requirement But she was EXTREMELY helpful and cared about my progress I still did really bad but its definitely not her fault Shes very clear funny nice and approachable She asks for questions at every step in processes Take her if youre decent at math Nobodys better 
She makes learning math fun  easy She has an upbeat attitude  a great smile 
Professor Kaufmann is the best math teacher I have ever had She gives clear and concise explanation of every topic with many examples done in class She tells you not to get the textbook and you really dont need it The first exam our class average was  points above the course average 
Professor Kaufmann is great Shes not as warm and fuzzy as other teachers but her sheer ability to make you understand is amazing I am not good at math but I followed lectures easily and got any extra issues taken care of at office hours She is much better than most other math professors she is much recommended 
Gail is an excellent teacher Lectures were crystal clear and she was very helpful after exams Very engaging both in lecture and oneonone Doesnt use the textbook very much Somehow made calculus fun and engaging If the Engineers dont snap up all the spots in the class LA students should take it without question

Extremely nice teacher friendly and helpful Tests are fairly easy Project takes a lot of time Overall a very good class 
Horrible class Useless information She is so disconnected from her students 
The class is easy if you put minimal effort into it The homework is fairly annoying and tedious Kaufman is easygoing and cool but the class is boring and meets at the dumbest times Seriously think about your scheduling before taking this class The scheduling is dumb

Shes extremely clear in her teaching style and always asks if you have questions Shes very availible if you need help The tests are pretty easy but theres a lot to do for the final project Shes a GREAT teacher though 
she is hands down the best math professor ive ever had she always asks for questions throughout the lecture and she prepares you EXTREMELY well for every exam her classes always have higher scores on tests too 
The best math teacher Ive ever had

Probably the worst professor Ive ever had She gave out an insane amount of reading and was entirely unreasonable in her grading criteria She once humiliated the class by claiming that the papers were not good and then went on to explain why they werent in a very argumentative manner Cannot stress how much I wish I didnt take her 
An excellent teacher and a marvelous course Carla is passionate and dedicated Shes quite speedy but extremely clear which balance out 
Shes clear funny and overall great Clearly one of the best professors in Halligan Take this class 
prof seems bewildered by her own material is constantly claiming she is dyslexic which is why she is always screwing up formulas on the board she is nice but pretty useless as a professor

This class is very much required to graduate but it was my favorite class this semester Tanya is such a genuine person and her class on love and sexuality is very interesting  minute class flies by because she facilitates good class discussion Shes not an easy grader but motivated me to work harder for a decent grade Manageable class 
She is well intentioned but makes a lot of mistakes on the board Not the greatest at explaining either but you can get by with some effort 
Terrrrrrrrible teacher class always goes late she never finishes lessons and messes up a lot 
Very good intentionsvery bad at explaining Also beware that she might write something on the baord wrong not catch her mistake and leave you confused about it for a week or so 
you should really pick another professor cause hahn is bad 
Constantly makes mistakes during class However she works hard to make sure everyone understands the concepts with handouts reviews and quizzes that just assess your understanding and dont count If you cant get a better prof shell be ok 
She is not easy to understand and constantly makes mistakes to the extent that lectures are incredibly boring and confusing Try to get a different calc professor 
Shes really a sweetheart but she cant teach for her life She makes mistakes ALL THE TIME and doesnt usually catch them She tends to confuse people too if you have trouble with math and learning from the text dont take her section A bazillion people dropped out in like the first  weeks 
She is very very bad A very nice person but couldnt teach if her life depended on it 
she messes up alot on the board 
Great teacher gives plenty of examples is always open for questions and extremely willing to help out with any difficult concepts extremely nice 
She is horrible Makes tons of mistakes every class Dont take her class unless you can learn on your own 
oh god it was a nightmare shes a nice person but a terrible lecturer DO NOT take this class if you have any trouble learning math she cannot teach you anything and will only confuse you in the end 
One of the worst professors I have ever had in my life By the second week most people quit going to class because she made no sense She misspeaks and taught math with POWERPOINT slides The slides werent even very clear or readable Learned more from the textbook She is nice but cant teach 
She was so confusing and boring Try to avoid if you can

I understand in a classroom setting that its easy to make an error and thats ok But if a professor is approached privately after class about an error and brushes it off with a tone of infallibility and condescension that is not ok Math is meant to be rigorous and that rigor is more important than ego Not an isolated incident

Proff Feigenbaum is great Math is NOT my strongpoint in fact its the subject Ive always been most insecure about Feigenbaum is the best math teacher Ive ever had BY FAR and I came away from the class deffinately feeling stronger in the subject She makes herself SO available to her students and is really invested in you doing well 
The best of Tufts no doubt hands down 
Shes such a sweetheart Honestly shes like your favorite grandma who gives you advice on life and shares her wisdom with you Shes just absolutely lovely 
She is so sweet and super helpful but this particular class history of math she covered so much material and covered almost all of it on exams It was almost complete memorization of proofs and LOTS of geometry Shes a great professor but this class was one of the hardest Ive taken at Tufts 
Lenore is an amazing professor I am terrible at mathematics but she helped me understand and appreciate mathematics She is kindhearted and extremely accessible Prof Feigenbaum is the type of amazing professor you always hear about 
Prof F is wonderfully hilarious really patient and always willing to help Shes one of the rare gems in the Math department Even if you never have a class with her sit and speak with her her life has been incredible shes done everything and has insight without being pushy or judgy and shes small and elderly and just plain awesome

I cannot say enough good things about Professor Pinto She is a great lecturer and connects the subject matter to real life in a profound and sincere way You can tell that she loves Anthropology and enjoys teaching I had a great time doing the readings and completing all of the essays 
pinto is a great professor she cares about her topics and her students she is very available outside class her expectations are very clear and well defined so if you put in work expect to do well readings are interesting but seem not to be necessary for success 
Professor Pinto is excited and interested about medical anthropology and communicates her enthusiasm well to her students She is open about what she wants from her students and is incredibly accessible outside of class One of my favorite professors at Tufts and definitely the most helpful 
LOVE her Pinto is brilliant and interesting even if topic is not that exciting Grades fairly entire grade based on  short papers and a final paper Readings sort of unnecessary unless you plan to use them in your paper Attendance at every lecture definitely optional Didnt think I would like this class but ended up loving it 
I honestly love her Extremely genuine intelligent articulate and even funny at times The class presents challenging theories and concepts but Pinto makes it understandable Very approachable outside of class and loves helping students out 
She is absolutely fantastic and critical I want to be her best friend

Prof Pinto is a fantastic professor and advisor She is happy to help you out with anything you need or to just chat with you I would definitely recommend taking a class with her 
PInto is incredible The information is so cool After being in her class I want to be her best friend I never thought Anthro could be so fun Youll write papers There is a bunch of reading But youll love it She is smart talented and makes you want to learn more Take her class you wont regret it She is absolutely brilliant

Lectures only introduced material and did not provide thorough explanation Textbook was full of typos and not much more helpful than she was Unclear about what was expected for the exams and grading was often unfair Had to submit regrades for most exams and point out errors on homeworkwhen she didnt know how to answer a question she avoided it

clearly proficient in her field she knows what she is talking about unfortunately she also assumes that you know what shes talking about even if you have had no previous teachings about mexican history  somewhat intimidating not a breeze but worth it to hear a great lecture

Professor Drachman is a good history professor Courtship in America is a pretty easy seminarwe played board games for the entirety of one class periodbut you learn so much interesting stuff about womens role in all aspects of American cultural history Very understanding and sweet Brings snacks to class

Seems to think that her class is the only one were taking Goes weeks with nothing assigned and then assigns two large assignments on the same day Explains how to write a paper and micromanages group work like we are in high school Class material is really interesting but the disorganization makes the class way less interesting than it should be 
awful 
TOUGH GRADER 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Shes very passionate about the material but she is a tough grader 
Class was interesting but slow at times Be prepared to take notes the whole time She brought in a few fun ideas and activities but the students interest was not as high as hers Tests were fair 
very knowledgeable and enthusiastic also friendly and approachable excellent class excellent professor 
Professor Drachman was my advisor from day  and I took  or  classes with her at Tufts Didnt do all that well but I had never even realized how much womens history is ignored usually so that was good Yes shes selfinterested but also wellstud 
way in to her self if it benefits her then she does it no altruistic qualities at all 
Most people who take her class will find out all sorts of things about womens history that they never knew A very interesting course although my right hand nearly fell off from the mad scribbling of notes we had to do every lecture Overall I enjoyed learning about the topic very much and I would be willing to take another class with her

Priscilla may be the worst public speaker in the world She cannot say a sentence without using the word um The expectations for what content the and structure the paper were never made clear even after asking about them multiple times Just because connect with her personally does not mean you will get a better grade in the class

CARING 
This class was brutal Not quite sure how she got a job in teaching let alone in a university That being said she is nice in regards to helping you with deadlines and issues you may have with writing projects etc if you email or talk to her But if you are in her class be ready for long boring confusing pointless lectures EVERY CLASS 
I find her to be very annoying and she shows up late to class everyday She doesnt know what she wants for an essay She makes you workshop your essays and face public humiliation in front of your peers 
It is true that she is unclear and unorganized as if she doesnt know what she wants however her poetry class is great and if you dont like having your work workshopped just dont take the class but the comments dont hurt There is no right or wrong 
Awful teacher she will make your writing so much worse she constantly stutters and has no command over the english language and even less of a right to teach it avoid her if possible

Professor Sneff was a very nice lady However she is very vague with assignments and her lectures are boring Try to take another teacher if possible Her grading scale is all over the place and you will never know what grade you will get 
Nice lady really tries to teach you well but fails She is a total space cadet Arrives late to almost every single class Nice thing is she lets you do rewrites until you get an A on a paper So if you put in the work which really means nothing you will get an A 
I really disliked the professor personally and found her approach to writing pretty unhelpful I ended up dropping the course after two classes 
Unclear unprepeared uninteresting If you get her switch to another section Pronto 
Im pretty sure that she comes high every classyou can tell by the sunglasses indoor so it helps to come to the class high to really appreciate what she is saying However the workshopping is really helpful and my writing got better And you have to get an A on the first few papers 
She says um every other word and every word in your essays has to be the exact right word or you get hacked to pieces It is possible to get a good grade but its a hassle my writing got worse because I had to revert to middle school sentence structure in order for her to follow what i was trying to say On the upside she is a bee keeper 
pick another section she makes you rewrite and workshop everything she is not good she does not make herself very available and her assignments change everyday NO

Professor Sneff is a smart lady but her classes are long and not very engaging She does try her hardest to be helpful so go to her office hours if you want feedback as she allows you to revise one paper Lastly her grading criteria can be unclear And by the way she is an English professor at Penn State now 
Shes kinda nuts Rambles on about assignments that still arent clear When discussing literature she wasnt very open to ideas other thana her own Nice enough but overall not a great teacher 
Very unclear on what the assignments actually are Of the three books we read only of them ever had a writing assignment attached to it The longest we ever spent discussing a book was  class periods Write what she wants to read 
Almost all of the reviews of her have been negative After being  of the way done with her class I can see why Her teaching methods are ineffective and her critiques are discouraging After completing the course I will promptly forget everything she has taught me because I am sure that her advice has hurt my writing more than it has helped

Would start off every single class with a sarcastic remark about how much we wanted to be there or loved reading going to class seeing her etc Goes on tangents Condescending Weird need to feel powerful Treated us like we were toddlers We were punished for being late and using our phones and had the class slides removed from us 
She is kind of annoying but not a hard class If you read the textbook and attend lecture you will be fine on the tests She is very particular so make sure you read and follow her rubrics TAs do most of the grading She wont let you use any electronics in class which is annoying in a  person lecture

One of my favorite professors at Tufts She was a bit goofy and tended to go on tangents but it was evident that she genuinely cared about our understanding of the subject On a personal note she was very supportive of me when my grandmother passed away offering help if I needed it which I think shows how truly wonderful she is 
Shes very nice but tends to baby and spoonfeed her students Its very annoying She doesnt really want you to learn just wants to take care of you Has clarity because she is so simplistic

Saskia is one of the nicest most helpful and most engaging professors Ive had yet Although the daily homework can get annoying it definitely helps with your german and prepares you for her tests If you have a choice between german professors choose Saskia 
Great Teacher Very Helpful Tests are fair and there is no final nor midterm Workload is daily HW but nothing to extreme 
Saskia is the best She is genuinely concerned with how everyone feels about the class and very willing to guide you if you need help She is so sweet and tries to make sure shes not overwhelming us The difficulty of the class depends a great deal on your experience level with German and is a lot of presentingwritinggrammar

Saskia is the best She is very clear very helpful and always available She cares about your improvement and seems to take a personal interest in all her students Additionally all deadlines are soft which is amazing when you have  tests in a week and no time to write a German essay by Friday 
Frau Stoessel is for sure the best foreign language teacher Ive had at Tufts She really cares about her students and wants you to get to know the German culture The course was well structured althought the oral presentations were a little tedious But her presence in class made everything better 
Very approachable about any concerns you might have and always willing ot help you A wonderful professor and person 
One of the best professors at Tufts She was extremely organized with her lessons and assignments which relly helped me learn the material She is always willing to help and is one of the nicest people around 
Saskia is a master at inspiring genuine interest in German and the language skills of her students  all with a light touch She presents material clearly and creates a welcoming environment in which to make mistakes and learn from them Prior to taking her class I was about to drop German Instead I went on to full proficiency within  years 
Saskia is actually the greatest She is incredibly helpful and forgiving with late work Her exams are very fair and if you do the work youll be plenty prepared for them Great class

Professor deRuiter is one of the best professors at this school Every class was entertaining and engaging She plays ice breakers the first couple minutes of class and she really cares and is funny I left everyday wanting to tell people about what I learned I would  take another class with her and recommend others to do to the same 
Professor DeRuiter is interesting and engaging but sometimes her lectures are disorganized and its hard to figure out what exactly is importantwhat she wants you to know That being said she cares about her students and wants them to succeed 
Her lectures were very interesting and understandable Light workload and fair tests 
Made social psychology one of my favorite classes at Tufts Funny clear and very reasonable Great lectures 
She was a really good professor There were a few moments where the lectures were a little boring but then we also did a handful of activities that were both entertaining and taught something relevant I would recommend her and the course 
Wonderful woman Inspiring lectures great inclass activities My goal to take ALL her classes while at Tufts whether they be passfail or auditing 
The syllabus was just too easy and commonsense filled to be interesting 
made psych  bearablevery funny 
Able to relate material well to real life situations Always going beyond the ordinary lecture bringing in videos newsclips etc Highly recommended 
She was one of the teachers for Intro to Psych and I really enjoyed her lectures Very organized very clear 
I love Professor Nathanson I had her for part of PSY  and for PSY  She is a sassy Israeli and keeps her classes really interesting by bringing in clips and lots of pictures etc I loved both of her classes and am absolutely going to try to take more 
she is awesome very funny makes the class interesting 
this class was horrible sam sommers teaches it in the fall semester and i really wish i had taken it with him bummer 
The pace is about  pages of reading a week in the textbook The font is comparably big in the textbook so the readings go by fast Psych  is an easy course as long as you do all the readings and study well The lectures are all very interesting and fun You wont be bored 
So much fun to take classes from hard but no unnecessary work 
Most interesting of  lecturers in class Funny at times but went through some slides too quicklyjumped around I got the impression that she thought we didnt want to be there so that was offputting 
I enjoyed her in class but not outside Shes in charge of determining if outside classes can be transferred in to count toward your psych major and shes a hard about it 
If you are taking social psych take it with Prof Sommers in the fall  youd be making a mistake taking this section 
worst psych class Ive taken and Im a psych major i thought social psych would be interesting but sinaia proved otherwise brushed off students who asked questions clearly didnt know the answers 
She was one of the best teachers I ever had I really enjoyed her inclass demonstrations they make the reading material clear

Took class on love and sexuality in fairytales She picked readings and topics that were really interesting She has mandatory rough drafts which she reads through and then helps a lot 
The direction of the class was entirely unclear as was her advice on essays and though she was enthusiastic about the subject she REFUSED to give higher than a B as getting an A in eng means you pass out of the English requirement which she clearly didnt believe in A decent bit of work for st semester freshman year as well 
Really good class She chooses interesting topics and is so helpful She gives you great notes on your rough draft to help with your final draft And she brings food to class once in awhile Definitely recommend her

She is the BEST 
AWESOME PROFESSOR Constant skits fun anecdotes that actually played into learning the language She was simply the most enthusiastic person I have ever come across Coming into the course I really did not want to take German again but she COMPLETELY changed that opinion TAKE HER COURSE IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE 
Geraldine is awesome She is very casual and fun Readings are interesting and not too long Essay assignments are often creative Fun class 
Oh sweet Jesus Geraldine is incredible She is so cool and forgiving She teaches you a lot of slang What you really need to know in Germany and is so nice on tests and homeworks You might not learn the most grammatical German possible but it is so worth it  
Really sweet woman but class is not worth going to Its all straight out of the book Easy A 
Shes so nice Class is interesting

Professor Leavell is a sweetheart who is very enthusiastic about the subject and cares about her students I felt comfortable discussing any issues with her She always offers you tea or coffee if you meet with her outside class and she once brought a jug of apple cider to class 
Professor Leavell is the absolute best She is incredibly smart and one of the nicest most helpful professors you will have during your time at Tufts She doesnt expect you to work hard since as a Tufts student you will most likely already do so but rather she expects you to do well How well you do will determine your grade Shes awesome

Professor Leavell is an amazing person and teacher She exudes an incredible enthusiasm for both her class and life She is a little slow in returning papers but her comments are definitely worth the wait I learned so much I wish she taught more classes 
Professor Leavell is a really enthusiastic teacher who marches to the beat of her own drum Very easy class where everyone was encouraged to participate

GET READY TO READ 
The psy class I took had  professors who alternated doing lectures and looking back I think Prof Race was my favorite She goes over the material multiple times to make sure you understand it and you have plenty of time to write stuff down in your notes The class had lots of reading though 
Exciting class overall But I thought the topic itself was quite interesting before I even took this class Obviously this prof knows what shes teaching and does a great job at communicating it Its not necessarily easy stuff but if you study the materials as recommended its not that hard 
I may be a bit biased but as a female student I usually prefer female teachers they are not as arrogant as male teachers I also prefer teachers who get to the content instead of just trying to entertain us We are not babies This is why I think this is a very good class Lectures are clear and to the point 
Pale is not IN right now Her class has lots of small time consuming assignments and WAY TOO much reading because she basically covers it in class anyways Presenting articles is the worst  teach your own class Her tests are hard but she scales She is scary and hardly ever smiles 
Intelligent serious and available prof She is a role model for me She taught important material making it fun too Also I enjoyed a lot the conversations outside the classroom Id recommend taking this class and getting to know this professor 
She sucks Her lectures make no sense 
This class made me realize that studying the brain can be fun Above all it made me think about the notion that we ARE our brain Excellent professor 
I like this class a lot The material is very interesting and it makes me want to learn much more The examples used in class are very powerful and they helped a lot BTW Reading some of the comments below are you guys taking the same class Im in this class and we have not had the exam yet so how could you have failed the exam 
Fantastic professor I loved the change blindness demos They really show that ones intuitions about ones own perceptions and thoughts can be totally misleading This class opened new conceptual horizons for me 
one of the worst professors ive ever had not quite her fault though she has the wrong personality for lecturing intelligent and cares though give her  years and she may be a good professor but if youre reading this soon take this class in the fall  with sommers dont risk having her 
Haline was hard Much harder than a majority of the  person class I took with her could handle Fortunately for me I jump at a challenge and learned a LOT but the same cant be said for practically anyone else in the class She is very smart but doesnt know when people are not following her arguments She also needs to slow down when lecturing 
This class is just great better than I had expected Prof Schendan is very clear smart knowledgeable and helpful 
I took this class and learnt basically nothing I only went to this class for the first two weeks She basically teaches from the book almost word for word I can read and comprehend the book just fine without her Her exams use the same examples as the books or some small variation from it This class is somewhat a joke 
Fantastic class I think Ill go into neuroscience after I finish here at at Tufts 
Clear lectures Professor was very nice and helpful 
this is potentially the worst teacher you will ever encounter she teaches you absolutely nothing ruins your life with deadlines and has absolutely nothing valuable to add to your academic education avoid her at all costs 
Learning about the brain is boring but the topics get better Her animated Powerpoints are very interesting to look at but they can be hard to take notes from She does many fun demonstrations that end up on the test 
Clear and informative lectures Very available One of my favorite professors so far 
great prof she really knows what shes talking about and still manages to display it in a very clear cut fashion the lectures follow the book to some extent but she definitely explains it more in depth so attendance is important the tests were pretty straightforward she does have kind of a fastpaced lecture so recorders are good 
Excellent class Interesting material clear lectures Professor is very helpful and seems to know a lot 
Very interesting topic afterall Better than I was hoping for I thought I would be bored to death with all the biology and what not Instead the teacher is able to make the class exciting She is very passionate about the topic which helps a lot The classes are clear and I feel Im learning quite a bit 
Her lectures are very interesting although she basically repeats what is written in the book She keeps the students awake by constantly demonstrating and asking for volunteers etc Her power point is animated colorful and easy to understand 
fairly clear but boring her test was very reasonable 
I really like her She sometimes rushes through details but her demonstrations and animated presentations keep things fun and interesting She is very nice and sometimes dresses like the girl from resident evil fyi 
I like this class Unlike other classes on fluffy topics this one has some real content It is more challenging than other classes but I feel like Im actually learning something Prof Schendan is passionate and knowledgeable Office hours are a lot of fun since she knows so much stuff and she seems to enjoy talking with students 
Prof Schendan is very clear and entertaining I especially like the clips and animations she uses to illustrate key concepts 
very boring professor her slides are extremely unorganized and very difficult to follow you really have to read the pages in the textbook if you hope to do well on her test she does do a lot of demos in class though that make understanding the material easier 
If you want a class with open response test questions graded by a TA using a strict syllabus leaving no room for alternate correct responses to misleadingly worded questions then this is the class for you This class made me switch majors 
This class is really cool The demos are very interesting and fun and help clarify some of the more abstract concepts This prof is very smart gives clear presentations and seems to know a lot Very helpful and nice too Since I like science shes a bit of a role model for me FYI LOL true her dark clothes are kinda interesting

Worst prof I have ever had The only positive thing about this course is that you fulfill your World Civ requirement but there are better ways to do that She is unhelpful disorganized and the readings in no way pretain to the subject It is extremely boring too Dont take Epidemics

Shes very friendly and easy to talk to but very terrible at grading and constantly late to class 
Shes friendly but super unorganized and is always late to class I found the video for the class to be my main source of information and really enjoyed them She assigns a lot of reading most of which I didnt feel was necessary

LECTURE HEAVY 
GROUP PROJECTS 
She assigns an unreasonable amount of irrelevant reading which is then repeated in lecture It makes going to class a waste of time but she grades heavily on participation She was at least  mins late   mins of setup every class The tests required citation of specific texts with no notes Extremely workheavy at the end of the semester 
Her lectures were all over the place and after class I was never quite sure what she wanted us to get out of them There were a lot of readings but they were usually good and the movies were really good too Not the best teacher because shes so vague but she wants everyone to do well she just doesnt help the students achieve that goal 
really smart professor 
This class was such a disappointment Prof Taylor has moments when she is entertaining and interesting but they are few and far between Her lectures are painfully disorganized and we were never where the syllabus suggested we should be There was a lot of reading a LOT and though it was great material students cant be expected to read all 
worst professor ever 
She is disorganized but very helpful and reasonable and knows that she tends to be scatterbrained 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
Professor Chiesa is great Had her for ME and ES Encourages group work during class to solve problems collaboratively Encourages you to learn the material to know it not just for the grade

Seora Risse is a decent Spanish teacher but she isnt very clear at all If you dont learn well on your own I wouldnt suggest taking her class because most of the learning in her class occurs on your own She also isnt clear at all on homework so beware of assignments or else you will miss a few Otherwise a pretty nice  chill professor 
Class was fine I thought there was too much stuff covered and not enough time to go over it 
Really enjoyed Risse Super easy grader and the tests are pretty easy and straightforward too She makes the class easygoing so Id recommend her if you want a chill teacheroverly fair grader 
I think this class is supposed to be more of a review of grammar because I never felt like she was teaching a new concept just summarizing Homework is confusing because she will write some of it on the board and expect you to look in the syllabus for the rest of it Shes very understanding about the work load and turning in late assignments 
Very nice person very understanding with sickness or technology problems The assignments are in too many places however and tend to get majorly jumbled and confused If you can figure out the system and turn in your work its an easy A

Professor Risse is very sweet and a solid Spanish professor and I think that she teaches the Spn grammar well I felt that I learned a lot in her class The grade is based on  quizzes  tests participation  compositions and attending the recitations If you turn everything in and act upon feedback its a very attainable A

Shes REALLY chill for a normal professor shes okay if you hand in homework late or if you dont get things right the first time or if you mess up your grammer it a low pressure course 
Risse really cares about her students She is not a native spanish speaker so she often speaks in English It is pretty easy to get an A if you put in the time She was great in office hours However she was a little scatter brained and disorganized Lovely person and excited to help you along the way 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
Really confusing about assignments and homework Doesnt really explain things properly A lot of unnecessary busy work 
really nice and tries hard but doesnt know what shes doing and the class is very jumbled and unorganized 
One thing I love about Risse is that her Spanish is easy to understand In her class she gives you plenty of opportunity to practice the language and speak it However it was often confusing what homework was assigned because shed write some on the board and wed also have to look at the syllabus every night and do those things as well

I didnt like Koizumi sensei at first to be honest because I thought she was a little scarymean but I put in more work towards the end of the semester and came to the conclusion that this is just her teaching method In actuality she cares a great deal and tries very hard with all her students If you take Japanese at Tufts take it with her 
An amazing supportive and fun teacher if youre on her good side If not she will tear you a new one Her inane attempts at humor grow tiring at times If you are willing to put in the effort you WILL learn a lot from koizumisensei 
koizumi sensei is a wonderful teacher she knows exactly how to motivate her students she is harsh at times but is really happy every time she sees her students improve she cares a lot about building a personal relationship with students at the end of the semester she invited the entire class to dinner and took the bill

Koizumisensei is really great Shes funny and energetic and also very helpfull and understanding She makes sure everyone in class truly understands topics even if it means spending time out of class helping her students

Incredibly intelligent enthusiastic and very concerned with her students progress Really wants to make sure we engage with the material tolerant of alternate viewpoints and readily available outside of class 
Very intelligent Class a little all over the place with disorganization but she made up for it 
Books are very interesting But the class is rather large for English and as such discussion tends to be a bit fragemented She does a good job with lectures Exam with factual information ended up being a killer for me personally  I know plenty of people who did well Decent class but be careful to monitor your grades

Apparently Im the only student who doesnt love Professor Sharpe Shes a nice woman and accessible outside of class but she took an entire month to return our first essays her feedback was cryptic her class lacked structure and a semester later Im not sure what Im supposed to have learned Steer clear if youre not an English major 
The class was supposed to be American Women Writers but I felt like I was taking a class on race which is not at all what I was expecting The books are very good but you will only appreciate the class if you like focusing solely on race 
This class was a challenge Too many online posts  per week and not enough engaging with the material the class size was too large We never seemed to have enough time to talk about anything in depth That being said she is a nice woman and a good teacher  I think the class was structured poorly 
Undeniably one of the best professors I have ever had in college She is extremely smart and passionate She encourages class discussion although sometimes she talks too much She makes you work hard and think but it is well worth it to learn from her EVERYONE should take a class with her 
theoretically astute interesting personable and the hottest female professor in the english department

Professor Hutaff is wonderful She is passionate and knowledgable about the material She is an expert at rather than lecturing on the right way to interpret things asking thoughtprovoking questions and encouraging students to keep an open mind There is a good deal of reading but she is not a strict grader Very sweet and understanding 
Peggy is a stellar professor and the most wonderful advisor  person Miss out on one of her classes at Tufts and youve missed out on a lot Her grading method is a little different but she is always honest and fair I would definitely say she is my favorite professor at Tufts Id specifically recommend REL   Intro to New Testament 
Very closedminded to other opinions very unwilling to discuss topics other than Judaism and Christianity mainly Catholicism and overall I only gained annoyance from this course 
Professor Hutaff is amazing I have personally heard more than one student tell her that she is their favorite teacher ever and is certainly was mine I found New Testament to be a great introductory class with interesting material  PS Not for the religiously closed minded 
Peggy is a Great teacher Intro to Hebrew bible was my favorite class It opened my eyes to new things and every class was fun to go to At times her feminist theology students and her get in the way of the discussions but usually the discussion based classes are great LOTS of reading but its interesting 
Impossible to hear her talk during lecture  Get a front row seat Super easy A Gives As to everyone Graded on an overall how she feels youve improved by the end of the semester If you put some effort in and talk a couple times in class youll be fine The topic is horrendously boring and it is very hard to get through lecture wo nodding off 
I really like Peggy  she is one of the best professorslecturers at Tufts However if you are even a bit open minded you will be frustrated by the number of closeminded  and conservative students in this class They will stubbornly argue with you and personally attack you if you even suggest a feminist interpretation of anything 
Take this class Peggy has provided me with the strongest and most inclusive learning environment Ive ever had the privilege to experience She is incredibly thoughtful and intelligent Fem Theo is not your ordinary class It has been foundational in my academic work and has informed my worldview in so many unexpected yet delightful ways 
Shes the BOMB 
Shes so unbelievably sweet She brings cookies to class every day and baked a cheesecake for our class on the final day She assigns A LOT of reading so be prepared for that There arent a lot of grades either our only grade was our final paper 
I wish I knew how to sum up how amazing Peggy is She gives tons of reading but understands when you get behind The final is very long but there isnt a lot of other mandatory work This class will open your mind and make you think in ways you never thought possible TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU DO NOTHING ELSE WITH YOUR LIFE the end

While feminist theologies is probably the best class I have ever taken the final essays are ridiculous She assigned  separate  page essays  space in the middle of finals week well after the last class The essays werent due until the th of May after the dorms close Other than that it is a great class 
Great class and professor She is the best for this topic She is not a tough grader It is possible for all to get an A Lots of reading Be ready to write a lot on exams midterm and final Otherwise she had us write only one short paper and two or three short quizzes which are not graded 
She is a fabulous Professor Some students have difficulty with her courses because she does not like to grade but she lets you know if you are doing poorly She is always available outside of class and she is the best advisor I ever could have picked 
super nice teacher but i was frustrated by her lack of organization she focused less on theology and more on the historical situtation of the bible 
Peggy is a wonderful instructor Not only is she extremely enthusiastic about feminism in theology she is willing to personally engage you in the subject Naturally controversy will be generated so be ready I did not consider myself a feminist before  now I have a new appreciation for these ideas Not afraid to now say I believe in equality

I fall asleep everyday in this class Its an  person class yet for some reason she lectures the entire time No discussion whatsoever 
Excellent professor and class Work load is huge but doable  if you have trouble with time management consider yourself warned Although the reading is not all pertinent to course requirements it is high quality and broadens the mind Her exams were VERY fair as was the course paper Extremely helpful outside of class Would highly recommend

The type of person youd want to get dinner with and learn from but not the type of person youd want as a professor Extremely unorganized takes  months to grade a midterm Only  forms of exams two of which happened to be  page papers in  hours Extremely lecture heavy too and she loses track of relevant topics so nothing gets done 
Very knowledgeable Lectures are full of facts and insights 
Course material is difficult She lectures by reading her notes directly Lectures are hard to follow except when she name drops and talks about her personal experiences 
Absolute WORST teacher I have had at Tufts or ever Unbelievably arrogant impossible to get in touch with lectures are disorganized and consist of her anecdotes and name dropping Assigns  pages of reading in  days and makes no reference to it in class Course expectations unclear Finally she SCALED DOWN MY FINAL GRADE AVOID AT ALL COSTS 
She is incredibly disrespectful of time In a  person seminar we lectured everyday We got our midterm back the week before our final without any specific feedback She is impossible to meet with outside of class and will not help you catch things she will be critical of when she grades your exams We read  books and talked about none in clas

She is a great professor dedicated and hardworking She wants all students to do well Chinese  is very difficult for those without any Chinese experience  it simple requires a lot of time spent outside of class BUT she will help you succeed in the class I highly recommend her 
The most boring professor ever I know people always say this about their prof but I really mean it Think of the most boring professor you ever had and then multiply it by  Whole rows of people were falling asleep in class Besides that she cannot teach She often messes up problems in class She couldnt add  
Ugh 
horrible teacher discouraged me from ever taking a biology course again Try your hardest to avoid her 
The worst professor that I have ever taken at Tufts Relies on boring powerpoint presentations too much and talks about her kids all the time Her exams do not make any reference to the material on lectures nor the book whatsoever Studying for her class seems almost pointless since all the material arbitrary Very misleading with students grades 
Dr Gaudette has been teaching for years and has this class down pat There are a few variations between years when she tries something different but its definitely a valuable class If you mess up a sample she works hard to find a way you can still complete the lab The overall class is hard but do the reading and its so worth it 
Professor Gaudette is actually very nice when you talk to her outside of class which was surprising because she gives the impression of being a bit mean at times Her class is hard but at least there is no lab I wouldnt recommend to fill a science credit but if needed as a requirement its ok 
Difficult grader you could understand all of the content of the class and find it really interesting but still not do well on her badly written exams She wants to help her students  and goes to great lengths to learn all of their names but she is incapable of giving clear concise explanations The textbook was clearer than her lectures 
Gaudette is a really nice woman but as a professor she is absolutely atrocious She makes a ton of mistakes mixing definitions etc up which makes learning biology practically impossible for someone who knows absolutely nothing about it She complicates everything and is horrible at clarification 
She was nice She really made an attempt to help everyone out and get to know everyone in the class It was a little hard but its Bio of course its at least a little hard 
This class wasnt much easier than Bio  Although its definitely a lot of work at the end I was proud of myself for getting thru it Though Gaudette can be y other times shes quite nice and she does make herself available for office hours  review sessions

Nice person outside of class but overall terrible at teaching Obviously knows a lot about the subject but clearly has had very little training in pedagogy Youll really need to teach yourself most of the concepts 
Worst teacher I have ever had the displeasure of having Incapable of transmitting information to students so if you cant teach yourself material this professor is out of the question Her exams are meant to trick you instead of testing comprehension of material while she has a very condescending manner for those who dont understand AVOID 
It is very possible to get an A in this course without beating yourself over the head Take advantage of weekly quizzes to help your final grade Show effort by attending help sessions and it will boost grade a bit If you attend class and take notes on the slides you dont need to open your book Tip Print out slides and take notes in margins 
boring lecturer does not teach anything awful 
seems nice at first but talks down to students and seems to try to make them look and feel stupid to make up for her own inadiquicies 
Dr Gaudette is extremely smart and knowledgeable about genetics but she simply cannot teach Shes all over the place and she is unable to explain simple concepts succinctly 
one of the worst teachers ive had here so far 
horrible professor She goes into advanced genetics stuff without going over the basics all powerpoint w just about no sample problems and if she does a sample problem shes likely to mess it up worst prof Ive had so far 
Pretty horrendous teacher especially compared to Feldberg who taught with her He makes her seem stupid and she is Shes also belligerent 
The tests are hardand dont need to be avoid this class and go to bio  even if u think that you dont know enough because she is not good she is really condescending and boring However she does make herself available for office hours and time outside class 
Prof Gaudette drove me crazy She speaks down to the students as if we are idiots but gets hopelessly confused when we ask questions The material she taught was interesting but it was too painful to pay attention

She had a test every two chapters which were fairly easy given you browse over the topics covered in the period and are prepared One presentation and skit during the semester but as long as you are creative she loves it No heavy papers and she is very kind and not a lot of homework You will do very well if you put effort into the class 
 words self absorbed genetics isnt interesting in the first place let alone her  vision or her Stanford degree or her superb math skills lectures were boring and exams make no sense are impossible 
Goes out of her way to make the  question multiple choice exams impossible I was so relieved when we moved on to the next professor in this class She teaches pretty clearly though Just beware the tests They will always be harder than you expect and it will be her fault 
Chew was one of the worst profs ever Other than learning many useless facts about her personal life she doesnt teach you anything Read the book its much clearer although the sections she assigns are rarely relevant Her test was ridiculous  the curve avg showed that The rest of Bio  was great so just deal w her  youll be ok 
Literally the worst The textbook will only confuse and mislead you she said Her test questions Scenario A true B true C sometimes true D sometimes true Now which of the answers is the most untrue 
Nice person went out of her way to be helpful However I feel like she does this to justify her absurd exam questions Oh you didnt understand Well its not my fault I tried to help as best I could If you take bio just remember that its not a class  learning isnt the objective Its a rite of passage designed to weed people out 
She is really helpful but her lectures stray from the point a bit 
I loved her In a class of  she learned my name and she was always there to help students She loves the subject she teaches and that makes it more interesting Her multiple choice questions are completely evil however It is downright silly how hard her tests are 
she was one of the worst teachers i have had my friends used to keep tally about how many times she would bring up herself in class make sure you do the practice tests in the yellow book was helpful in office hoursu have to force her to explain well

Well Francie Chew really cant teach because her lectures are so incoherent and she teaches through examples without explaing concepts However you could still nail her tests if you practice using the problem sets constantly and remember some of the answers because at least  of the questions she asked were very similar to problem set questions 
Test did not need to be that hard 
Her train of thought goes off on every tangent during lectureif you listen to her carefully she makes no sense and her tests are notoriously horrible as we all found out this year spring  
Bio  tests in general suck and have nothing to do with knowledge so good luck with that However Chew is nice organized and upbeat 
I honestly cant think of one good thing to say about her Maybe that shes happy a lot The material doesnt seem that hard at least not compared to Bio but the tests are deliberately confusing On her last test she had to drop two questions because more that  of the class missed them The class gets better but shes a nightmare

Heres the thing about Francie in Bio  Yes her tests are hard but it gets curved at the end And shes actually a good lecturer in that I clearly understood what she was saying and she organizes the material well It wont hurt to go to her first recitation and follow her study recommendations too 
I really cant think of a single good thing to say about this woman Shes a decent lecturer but she does go way out of her way to deflate students grades and to make all of the questions on her tests more difficult to understand than the material itself She is condescending and forces students to drop the lecture whenever she can Avoid her 
absurdly ridiculous test fell asleep during her lectures but shes friendly and clearly passionate about science 
Most stuck up prof ever her exams had nothing to do with the book or lectures and she was very unwilling to help actually told a student who had asked a question during a review session that he should know that by now 
she was a really annoying teacher like annoying to have to sit through the class and it made me never want to go her exam was tough and she didnt seem to get her point across that well 
Horrible teacher The average score on her test was an F becuase she didnt teach anything and the test wasnt on what she was trying to teach I would avoid this class if at all possible 
Prof Chew is a very nice woman That aside her test was awful You could go to all the lectures sit in the front row go to all the reviews study hard and still get a C in the class Thats exactly what happened and not just to me but to most of the kids in class Her tests are long and hard Just simply understanding her material is not enough 
After reading other commenets on Prof Chew I was expecting the worst but I absolutely loved Francie She was easy to pay attention to and she was available a million times during the week and her review sessions were actually helpful The tests were fair but graded pickyavg Pay attention to her lessons and dont miss any 
Ineptitude is alternatively spelled Chew She cant teach The material she covers in class is relevant to the tests but the tests do not accurately measure what students know about population genetics Ellmore and Bernheim are much better dont let Chew scare you off Just be prepared 
she teaches relatively well however her tests and her problem sets on mastering bio are ridiculous Impossible to do well in her tests but the curve is pretty good avg  seems like they are just weeding people out 
Professor Chew is very excited about the material but she is disorganised and is not a clear lecturer Multiple questions were removed from her exam because even other professors could not understand her Good person Bad lecturer 
In contrast to many on this site I found Prof Chews presentations hard to follow 
Shes the nicest professor I love her as a person but she can be confusing during lectures However the tests arent so bad not nearly as treacherous as they were in Bio She is very interested in the material and has a ton of experience in the field There are a couple group presentations that are a little challenging 
very nice very helpful best spanish teacher i have ever had 
She is very helpful fun and a motherly person Id definitely take spanish again with her

Doris is awesome She has a little bit of hardass in her but shes a great teacher and her classes are great if you put in the effort 
A great lecturer made the material crystal clear and the lectures interesting The homework was intense but she was always very helpful I have to say that she was by far the best professor I have had in my life 
Plays favorites in the classroom arbitrary with grading doesnt seem to care whether her students learn something from her or not 
Very good at explaining Willing to spend time with students Got me a job 
She just emailed the clas at   AM to tell us we have a quiz tomorrow or today 
Professors like her and her appologists in the administration are the reason I plan on never giving a dime to this school 
The most uncaring apathetic egotistical professor Ive ever had the displeasure taking a course with Stay away 
Very clear class wasnt that hard though she doesnt really seem to care if you are doing well but the classes are enough to do well in this class 
Did not understand anything of what she said in class Homework problems were atrociously difficult and not properly explained in class

Very hard tests not a good lecturer she had a grad student teach two classes and he presented the material more clearly than she did You will get a C or lower on the first tests but she curves everything up at the end The labs are not difficult but extremely timeconsuming 
Detweller is a very good teacher in terms of explaining french grammar and vocab However I found the class to be incredibly boring

Professor Campana is lovely she is so nice and animated in class which helps engage the class But I could not give you an outline of what we learned even if I tried There is no clear course of what she is teaching it all feels very random Its also ridiculously hard to reach her by email It feels like she checks it once a month 
Overall great class if youre interested in it Make sure you come to class having done the reading because she learns everyones names and WILL call on you if you look confused In general however the quizzes are really easy just identifying pieces of music and the essays are pretty straight forward Its easy to get an A in this class 
She was really excited about the topic even with a class that wasnt The workload was light but she would occasionally call on random people if she felt the class wasnt prepared If you raise your hand and give an opinion or go to her office hours she will love you and wont forget you The class can be rewarding and fun if you try 
Campana is fantastic While you may find the subject slightly boring at times esp at the beginning when youre mostly studying foreign film she is always enthusiastic Do the reading because she occasionally calls on people randomly Essays and tests are easy Shes great to work with outside of class and will often take you to tea Love her

The best Chinese teacher I ever had at Tufts 
explains grammatical points very clearly very interested in your progress can help out at any time invites you to events i would recommend this professor over the other chinese professors 
Great professor 
definitely has her obviouse favourites in class however she is one of the very few chinese teachers who can make sense out of even the simplest words and explain it using some culturalhistorical aspect enthusiastic and fun loving good to chat with too 
A passionate professor with a great sense of humor She always conceptualized learning Chinese as something that should be fun and not overly demanding She always allowed me to take a step back and gain perspective on what learning should be 
Difficulty depends on how much Chinese u kno 
I finally got to take a course with her as some of my friends really liked her and her classes My written chinese improved a lot in one semester but I did have to study very hard as she expects that everyone from HK is a native speaker 
Li Laoshi is arguably one of the best professors at Tufts She is incredibly helpful and approachable and genuinely cares about how students are progressing in her class She is not afraid to call you out if she thinks you can do better which can be somewhat embarrassing but ultimately very motivating If you take Chinese take with Prof Li

She wrote a book about writing art history essays It has guidelines that are expected on the test and with it the class was way easier I thought the lack of continuity between the different lectures made the class kind of dull but there were definitely some good professors 
scary 
Baskins expects a lot from her students Her classes are interesting and likes discussion She tends to fall behind the syllabus She does grade hard but if you work hard submit drafts and edit you will easily pull off a good grade Exams  just spit back what she told you with key vocab words and you wil be fine I love her viewpoint on art 
Baskins is a tough but fair professor Her lectures are always engaging and her encouragement of discussion adds a lot to the overall experience If you pay attention and think critically then you wont have any problems Also she WILL improve your writing skills x over 
This professor was wonderful Her lectures were always clear and concise In retrospect I did not expect to learn as much as I did in her classes Make sure you do the readings just because those additional resources really do help with following her lextures and also give alternative insights which become helpful during exams 
A wonderful professor who knows her stuff though dont expect a dog and pony show Serious students will like her 
not helpful very picky about what a good answer is on a test grades very hard 
although she tends to be rather repetative i think she is quite clear on what she wants and expects from the students its a lot of material to absorb but youd be surprised how much you learned in the end 
Brilliant a good person and extremely helpful She is almost obsessively concerned with her students progress if you go and see her which I highly recommend she will lead you to the answer Her antics alone make class interesting but be prepared to put in a lot of time on assignments 
She is very knowledgeable about her field and brings a lot of energy to her lectures Her comments are very helpful  she completely marks up your assignments and you still get a good grade She sometimes goes on tangents but at least theyre interesting 
Very engaging and interesting professor Very concerned with students progress and understanding Provides tons of feedback on assignments Overall very good class 
This class was beyond horrible It starts out alright but then she throws fourpart chorale harmonization at you and just expects you to know how to do it without very much explanation from her at all Shes too smart to be teaching this class 
What she discussed in class was a little too advanced for a music nontheory class without any prerequisites but her grading was very lenient She herself is also very wellmeaning and genuinely concerned for her students Excellent all around and an easy A so long as youre imaginative 
Wow This class was harder than any of my physics classes But she is very enthusiastic  very helpful outside of class She definitely challenges you which is hard but great if youre up for it Lots of work rigorously graded I learned a lot 
One of the best Professor Schmalfeldt is the most knowledgeable professor Ive ever had Take any and every class you have the change to take with her

Great teacher You will learn a ton in her class The class itself is hard but its easy to get a good grade if you do all the work Shes really smart and great at music theory 
The essential foundation 
I had her for the Beethoven class She was a a fantastic teacher Extremely enthusiastic and extremely knowledgable Her main goal was to have people learn and not just to give them work so she was very leniant on work and let people use a cheat sheet for the tests 
She is the best Spanish teacher Ive ever had She is challenging but very helpful I steadily improved as the semester progressed She is a hard grader on grammar but its all completely justified  she is willing to help you whenever you need Easy to approach sweet and understanding Shes definitely my favorite teacher at Tufts so far 
Super nice and encouraging 
This was one of the best spanish classes I have ever taken She truly engages her students I look forward to going to each class 
nicest professor very helpful highly recommended 
Kind Interacts with you like a real person Engaging 
Not a bad teacher but a really hard grader Our class average on everything was pretty low compared to every other spanish class Ive been in She expects perfection and marks you down for anything less 
Professor Weitzman can be a little moody so just watch out for that She can also be forgetful like she may agree to give you an extension and then forget about it and make you feel like you made no attempt to get the assignment in on time Other than that she is very sweet A bit of a hard grader 
Professor Weitzman is wonderful Although she is a stickler when it comes to grammar she really cares about her students progress and is always willing to take a moment to clarify something She was enthusiastic about all of the required readings and films and class discussions were never dull I highly recommend her 
Shes generally nice hard to read though 
Never been graded so unfairly 
I had her for spanish  She is an amazing teacher and does not speak any English during class nor does she let you a great way to improve speaking skills However she is the hardest grader when it comes to grammar EVER She is amazing but be prepared to get  points less than other professors would give you on exams and papers bc of gram

Abstract Linear Algebra now math  was super clear and well taught by Walsh Shes friendly and accessible and the homework is challenging but manageable We did lose time and thus curriculum material from spending too much time in class trying to schedule review sessions Overall great professor though and highly recommended 
she is helpful clear and willing to answer questions She encourages students to come to office hours and is very willing to answer questions All homework is out of the book and notes are lectured in class and easy to understand for the most part 
SO boring however the class is taught by two other teachers that are REALLY good so the class isnt a waste 
took the lab course with her she is competent but arrogant wants to seem genuine but isnt disliked working with her on such a close level 
Focused on one concept for a really long time coverclarifying it and not covering a lot of ground Found it difficult to focus on her when she moved so slowly Seemed nice though 
bushnells lectures were unbelievably boring they were clear but i fall asleep easilythe other profs were okay the class is good thoughdont let bushnell stop you from taking it plus you dont need to go to lecture to do welljust do the reading and show up for tests which arent bad 
Extremely boring and slow lectures Takes a very long time to go over a few concepts then leaves out other topics that are on tests but are only mentioned in the textbook She could definitely balance time and subjects better 
although lectures are boring she does a good job of explaining the topics without confusion plus the the two other profs teach too so the class stays lively 
bushnells lectures are so confusing and boring hey emily dont quit your night job 
She is TERRIBLE Never take a class with Bushnell Her class is incredibly disorganized and she is such a loony Her tests hardly reflect the material and her lectures are just crazy 
Bushnell is into what she teaches I took the class Psy Perception thinking it was so as in how we view and consider othersits literally perception as in how we physiologically view the world ganglion cells motion parallax etc The class feels easier than it is tests are miserable affairs activity sessions clear up a lot 
she is crazy really really crazy

Nancy was a lecturer who was sort of interesting to listen to but not at all informative and who didnt seem to care much about the class She wrote the tests based on what she thought was important but she gave no practice tests or anything to prepare students even though the testing format was different from the homeworks

She gets a bad rep but if you pay attention in class and read the textbook and do the homework it is an easy enough class Also if you do poorly on the test she often offers retakes even when most of the class does well and curves the tests if everyone did poorly

You dont have to go to class as youll learn more by reading the online text Just go to recitations read the text and go to review sessions before the exam and youll be fine

TOUGH GRADER 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Nancy is a good professor she does her best to keep her lectures interesting and will crack jokes often The problem is she teaches Ec  the biggest class a tufts with over  kids Because of this its hard for her to make any real connections with kids but I have friends who are upperclassman and they love her in the smaller classroom size 
Most unstructured class I ever took Nancy is a good lecturer but a terrible teacher She does not prepare her own exams so its always more difficult than the examples we see in class Deadlines for work are not set in the syllabus so expect random assignments given a week before the finals Decided to PF it even though my grades were fine 
TOUGH GRADER 
Nancy was off this semester Most lectures taught by guest lecturers which was inconsistent and confusing You have to do lots of assignments and study but she writes the tests herself based on what she thinks you should know If you need to take this class take it But dont take it for fun Because fun doesnt exist in Ec 
Just terrible 
TOUGH GRADER 
Didnt do a good job at teaching Actively discouraged questions by calling people idiots if she didnt think it was a smart question Rarely communicated with her TAs Take the class if you must then never go back 
Silvia was very engaging Excellent lectures Supportive of the students Very receptive to students feedback Useful grading rubrics She is enthusiastic and energetic and wants the same from students If youre hard working youll love this class 
Silvia is overly nice about everything She gives  negative feedback even when the grade is not perfect Is obtuse and not open to any new ideas or interpretations Prefers the fly on the wall to the involved student

At first I didnt know what to think about Professor Cant but after a while I learned that she is a nice caring lady who just wants her students to improve their level of precision in the Spanish language Assignments and their expectations are made clear ahead of time so that students can plan in advance and put their best effort in 
Shes so nice and helpful I was struggling with the grammar quizzes she gave us and she and I met during her office hours and she gave me really helpful tips Shes also very clear about what she wants you to do and she will answer any questions on it 
Shes sooo cute 
My first impression was that she was stern and unfriendly but she is actually very kind and helpful She appreciates when you take advantage of her office hours The class was interesting and made me more eager to pursue the language She does deduct points for minimal mistakes but she is fair overall 
Shes really nice and approachable Her spanish is crystal clear as are her expectations and assignments Lots of busy work in  though

This class was not particularly difficult although it definitely wasnt one you could slack off in either I found the workload manageable and the lectures engaging She did a good job of varying the classes between lectures small group discussions presentations and debates Shes also very sweet and incredibly helpful during office hours 
Cantu was a great teacher She did take off points for grammatical mistakes especially on the compositions but if you went to her office hours she was very helpful and told you exactly what you needed to correct to improve your grade In general her grading is fair and not as harsh as I thought it would be 
Prof Cantu was pretty boring and gradelocked like everyone predicted she would Exams make it easy to make little mistakes and shell deduct for every one Class is pretty boring too 
Poor teaching style knows very little and is not approachable 
Maybe we had different teachers because I thought she was very enthusiastic about what she teaches and is also very approachable Also a sweet woman  
The class was on an interesting subject matter but she was not a very interesting teacher I think the material was there to foster good class discussions but it was mostly her speaking in spanish the entire class and everyone not paying attention The tests were pretty hard too The readings werent very hard though

She speaks very clearly and though she can seem cold at first she is actually very approachable She is very willing to help go over papers during office hours and gives good feedback on essays Her grading is however pretty hard if you are prone to little grammar mistakes Not much preparation is needed for her class Some essays are hard work 
not helpful 
Im not super into spanish but Cantu made spanish  relatively painless Theres lots of busywork but thats departmental and not really her fault Shes clear and understanding and you read some interesting stories No major complaints 
Class consisted almost exclusively of the professor going over slides filled with bullet points on the readings wed done for that day which made going to class pointless if youd done the readings and difficult if you hadnt Her realm of expertise seems very narrow and she has an annoyingly indignant attitude towards many issues Stay away 
Prof Ascher is a wonderful understanding kind sweet person That said her teaching style leaves a lot to be desired I really feel like we didnt learn that much about the subject and there was very little organization or focus in the courses direction Readings are long and can be arduous Dont take GER  with her 
Shes absolutely a nut but has a real passion for the class and really wants you to love it too Projects are creative fun and easy And she wears purple shoes We think she made up the language 
She loves the subject but shes a horrible teacher Sitting through her lectures is torture She couldnt hold the class attention because she rambled and mumbled far too often She gives an easy A but its hellish to go to class 
I love Gloria Ascher Her passion for her subject is infectious Sclit has never been so interesting She loved any participation and class began with show and tell Prof Ascher is approachable and very sweet Not all the readings were that interesting but Ascher knows how to convince you that you liked them Take this class for Thors sake 
sweet woman wonderful reading assignments lectures were boring 
She is so sweet and very passionate about the subject She invited the class to her house to learn more about Ladino and Sephardic Jewish culture Shes a little spacey but lectures are still very interesting 
Scandinavian literature was very interesting and she had great enthusiasm and knowledge for the subject matter 
her class is awesome and prof asches is just really nice the class was amazing and not too demanding other than the readings which are actually really cool midterm and final were extremely easy i seriously recommend this class because it is AWESOME one of those classes you wont forget 
Possibly the sweetest woman alive but the class can be a little painful to sit through Shes wonderful but because she is easygoing a lot of people take her class just to fool around and she doesnt hear that well so she doesnt always know have a heart people Anyway dont expect to learn a lot but it IS an easy A and shes sweet 
she is the hottest professor 
Prof Ascher is a nice enough woman but as a teacher her grading is a little unclear and she doesnt pace the course very well The first few weeks have no work whatsoever but by the last few youll be expected to cram read  books for the final Nice woman but somewhat unorganized still the material was interesting 
Clearly passionate about her subject but disorganized Class does not follow the schedule spends several weeks on a single book realizes we are way behind and is rushes through the rest Few readings two tests and a freestyle project No clear grading which makes things difficult Very hard to get her attention in class 
This class was absolutely terrible The majority of the semester was spent on one text and then  were crammed in the last week of class It usually took her between  minutes to actually start class she rambled and the class was extremely repetitive Extremely easy to get an A really wonderful person but horrible horrible class 
Scandanavian Literature was the best course I took at Tufts 
Professor Ascher is the sweetest professor Ive had at Tufts and certainly my favorite Her passion for the subject material makes the class fun to attend and the subject matter interesting She starts every class by showing you picturesarticles of Iceland and viking related things for about  min Take a class with her you wont regret it 
Her most worthwhile class by far is Scandinavian Literature and it was one of the best classes Ive taken It was somewhat disorganized had no clear grading policy and would have been easy to skate by in However she picks a truly amazing set of readings and then expects you to be an adult and learn something from them Feels like grad school 
Gloria is a great teacher and a very sweet person Her genuine interest in Scandinavian literature made me fall in love with it as well Easy to pass and easy to love Unforgettable class read a lot of good books I highly recommend it

Tanya is the most amazing professor and human being She explains everything thoroguhly is extremely approachable and really tries and succeeds at helping students 
You will learn a lot in this class She is very clear in her teaching and helpful when you have questions That being said she does have expectations but if you do the homework and study for the tests you should be fine Id recommend taking this class 
Awful Teaches a Composition and Conversation course by making us read varied and inconsistent books because she is used to teaching literature courses Refused to teach or correct any grammar until we all did badly on the midterm She also seems to be eurocentric in her ignorant sweeping opinions of things which is ironic but mostly offensive 
She appears very uninterested in the material she teaches and unenthusiastic She provides little feedback and is a hard grader 
Great class I loved having her and really wish she taught the next level spanish class as well so that I could have her again We had a great class dynamic and she values her students and puts herself on the same level as us She is a very fair grader Shes a great teacher and works hard to make sure you learn everything well

This woman is probably the most wellrounded scholar on South Asia in the United States Classes are pretty interesting yet intense Her workload is quite demanding  pages of reading per week weekly critiquesessays of readings final paper presentation and a  page paper Highly Recommended 
Extremely helpful and knowledgeable professor 
Convoluted lectures but overall a relatively fair grader 
Shes really well read in the field and knows what shes talking about but can be slightly esoteric in her lecturesread the main text book so you can follow her in class Dont be overwhelmed by all the other readings shell assign bc her tests arent that bad If youre interested in the region or in history I would definitely recommend it 
TOUGH GRADER 
EXTRA CREDIT 
She is extremely unorganized During lecture she does not have confidence in what she is saying as if she is learning it while teaching She does not answer questions well and her tests are based off of the textbook so there is no real reason to go to lecture The tests are difficult because she asks oddly specific questions from the book

TOUGH GRADER 
I enjoyed the material and Prof Napiers teaching style However not a fan of her grading approach Weekly reaction papers are graded with checkcheckcheck which do not really give you a good estimation of how well you are doing in the class Vague participation requirements Can get marked off on essay tests without any reasons or notes 
Admittedly Im a bit biased I think this woman is the bees knees As long as you show genuine interest in her class shes usually fine with you Great to talk to very humble and superopen to the opinion of others If given the chance TAKE HER CLASSES 
very knowledgeable engaging lecturer a little hard to reach and can get off topic easily but overall she knows her stuff well and makes the class interesting watch the extras on the Animatrix to get her opinion on anime 
Her class was a bit dry and she has some rather unusual opinions and interpretations of works but fun nonetheless Just dont take her class as an easy course theres a decent amount of work 
I loved the Japanese Film class The environment that we were in as we sat in the comfy theatre roomed was one of the best experiences I had that semester The class was fullon discussion and lecture and the lectures were pretty much optional She was really open to everyones ideas and quick to admit if its something she has never thought of be 
Cool professor who is very knowledgeable but definitely not snotty about it Very open to new ideas At the same time you will hear a lot of things mostly from your peers that will make you roll your eyes Sometimes felt like the class was a platform for people to spew a lot of BS to be honest Fair amount of reading and writing but shes fair 
great teacher really knows her stuff some found her to go off topic but she manages to tie the material together nicely Fair grader and very approachable 
Pretty good class though sometimes it could get a little tedious Keep up with the readings since you talk about them in the weekly journals and discussions but if you miss a couple its fairly easy to get by Shes open to many ideas but make sure to do well on your midterm and final paperspeech Cool overall 
I really dont like her teaching styleif you can call it that She was unorganized not focused and her lectures generally skimmed over material without challenging preconcieved notions the average student might already have about JapanJapanese history etc I found her class Xtremely frustrating in its lack of focus 
Sra Pedemonte genuinely cares about her students However sometimes her grammar quizzes do not cover what she says will be on themeven if you study for  hours it is impossible to guess what might come up However she grades exams and essays very fairly Even though I did well in AP Spanish in high school though the work load isincomparable

Pedemonte is super friendly understanding and a great spanish professor She speaks only in Spanish some dont and assigns minimal homework The class is difficult but Pedemonte keeps things fun with candy and occasional dance parties She does a great job with Spanish  which can be somewhat dull material 
Prefoessor Koegel top my list of favorite professors at Tufts so far She is so kind so lovely and so clear in her lectures Bio  is the most interesting class that Ive taken here She takes the time to get to know you she is very accessible outside of class and her tests are very fairmostly short answer SO much praise to her 
Best class at Tufts by far Really interesting and never overwhelming I love her so much she the sweetest person always making sure you understand the material and making jokes about her little daughter She somehow managed to remember everyones name in the  person class Even mine even though I only spoke once

Dr Koegel is my favorite professor I didnt do well on the first exam and she was extremely helpful and approachable She makes her lectures as interesting as they can be for an intro bio class and seems to really care that everyone in the class understands The tests are hard but fair If you do the online practice and study youll be fine

Lectures are clear and very interesting The tests are HARD The difficulty is the questions ask you to synthesize many different concepts to come up with the answer Im not good at this so I found it infuriating because I knew the material but the test questions didnt reflect that Overall advice is to study in groups and do well on the labs

Probably the nicest professor I ever had she truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed After the first exam many people were feeling down and questioning if they could handle a career in the sciences and she was very supportive and even discussed her own endeavors with intro bio I really hope she teaches bio  next semester

She has a great reputation but she was actually very unhelpful and rude to me When I went to her to ask questions she kept telling me that I am not getting it and that I need to go look it up on my own and not go to her Arent professors supposed to help you when youre not getting it and having trouble

Professor Fuhram gave great informative lecturesshe was also engaging during lectures which really helped Going to office hours and recitation will also really help you in this classin both she explained a lot of information that was not emphasized in depth in class but will be on tests  Overall great class with a great professor 
Prof Fuhrman is pretty much my idol She clearly knows EVERYTHING there is to know about what she teaches yet is still so good at teaching itmaking it understandable She always answers every question thoroughly and clearly Her test is hard but only as a result of the material Reading the text is not necessary but probably helpful Love her 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
Fuhrman made me hate biology Tufts doesnt take AP credit for biology anymore so I was forced to repeat this class It would have been fine if her exams werent terribly worded It tested more on reading comprehension than actual knowledge of the material 
Hate giving Furhman a bad review because shes a good person but the way she taught bio  was thoroughly uninspiring and disorganized Lectures jumped around tests were easy to get points off on and I didnt feel like I learned anything conceptual I like bio but I was disappointed in bio  
While Professor Fuhrman is very nice and cares about students I thought her lectures were incredibly boring and organized in a confusing way Her test questions were poorly worded and designed to catch you on stupid mistakes She also provided almost no study material for tests other than homework Overall a very frustrating experience 
Cynthia is extremely understanding She allows you to ask ANY question during a test You can ask her what ANY word means even if it is a word you should definitely know Sometimes she allows you to use notes books dictionaries on test She believes that tests are simply chances to experimentar con la lengua Her deadlines can be flexible

If you go to Roger Tobins ratemyprofessor page youll see that I said it was the hardest class at Tufts University That class was a joke compared to this one By far the hardest class at Tufts University

Moon is really invested in making sure you get both the math and the history If you have questions or just want to talk she does her utmost to be available and help you There are readings to respond to and problem sets The readings are usually pretty interesting but some of the psets might be hard find someone to work with 
She shows great enthusiasm for this course and is really helpful  on  The main concern I have with her is how she teaches through proofs She oftentimes overexplains or goes into too great of detail which seems like a good thing but can over complicate a quite easy subject Overall a good teacher and is good for beginners 
 
She is an amazing teacher She explains everything in a very clear and concise way and makes lectures interesting She uses her own methods instead of the textbook which is helpful and often much easier to understand Overall a crazy good teacher 
The smartest and coolest teacher youll ever have 
She is a wonderful teacher and obviously a genius Her explanations are so clear and she always sticks up for the students best interest in the department I would take another class of hers in a heartbeat

She goes over the theory more than actual examples of problems in class but she takes any question that you ask her and is extremely helpful during office hours Shes also very clear in her presentation of her lectures 
Phenomenal Moon explains clearly and extensively concepts that previous teachers made seem impossible She makes it fascinating to come to class She treats you like you know what youre doing and doesnt waste your time but she also goes out of her way to make sure you understand People go to her class who arent even in it Take her class

A very wise philosopher Loved her lectures I took her summer class each lasted  hours but never bored me  if you are into philosophy 
She is very funny with a witty and sarcastic sense of humor She knows a lot about her subject and clearly loves it too The majority of my grade was based on participation and if you dont show up she will definitely notice 
Excellent teacher She is very good at conveying concepts in a way that her students will understand She truly cares about all of her students 
Extremely helpful accessible explanation easygoing fun nice enjoyed her class thoroughly an learned a lot 
Professor Kober is fantastic The reading can often be dense but she is determined to help everyone understand it Her way of making the material unintimidating fostered a great atmosphere for discussion Highly recommended 
Gal is one of the best professors Ive had at Tufts Her teaching style is extremely cooperative and she cares so much about what her students think and feel If youre taking Intro Philosophy take it with her She is so lovely Even though shes like the busiest person on Earth she always has time for her students Incredible prof 
An absolutely great professor It is quite clear that she cares about student understanding and wont move on until concepts are understood At the same time Professor Kober wont waste class time on material that isnt pertinent to the essays or boring Fantastic class fantastic professor 
She is as clear as a Philosophy Prof can be She is extremely helpful on papers if you go talk to her about them She will help you think through everything you need to 
If you want to use youre mind in class rather than regurgitate information like the majority of other classes than take phil  with her 
Take a class with her only if youre incapable of any independent thinking and can robotically and compulsively put up with nonsense She gives work that should set the standards for purposeless nonsense Her interest is students is contingent on them following her instructions verbatim Outside thinking and independent ideas are unwelcome 
Terrible lecturer Openly said that she writes lectures right before giving them Not surprising since she often cannot finish the lecture in time or she leaves  extra minutes at the end Also includes technical neuroscience terms in lectures without introducingdefining them VERY UNAPPEALING PERSONALITY Avoid if you can 
I did not enjoy this class at all Lectures were boring exercises were pointless often a mark of an inexperienced teacher This is a topic you should learn but do it with a different professor if you can help it at all 
The way she lectures is extremely boring and she treated all the students like we were in high school like forcing every student to submit questions before every class that were almost always useless With her intolerable personality and random grading I would recommend taking this class with a different professor 
Would not recommend 
I dont think that Dr Chauncey has been rated fairly so far Shes a good lecturer shes very funny and she has a good personality She can scare some students because of her intolerance for cell phones and browsers but if you actually are interested and pay attention it doesnt matter Go into her class with an open mind 
By far the worst class I have ever taken Dr C as she refers to herself is incapable of delivering a lecture of any interest She tries to act cool by sitting down for the entire class when really all this does is make the lecture even less engaging The grading on tests is incredibly inconsistent and she treats students like theyre six 
Great Professor Really interested in students understanding and knows how to make this normally boring class interesting Had the whole class over for brunch for presentations on the last day of class Take a class with her

Shes adorable  really kind and easy going The class is fun and pretty easy to do well in 
Adorable little woman Speaks verrrry fast so can be a little difficult to understand material is interesting enough but presentations end up taking up a lot of class time approachable sweet lady challenging tests but fair

Professor Marcelin is one of my favorite professors at Tufts Although the course was not easy she helped me work towards my goals and was always there if I had a question Would highly recommend this professor to anyone and look forward to staying in contact with her as she is a great mentor and person 
Marcelin is a difficult teacher Doing well in her class is also very rewarding She will make sure that you do the best that you could do but dont be mistaken her class is not simple by any means Work hard and read lots because she defines semantics 
So nice but she picks favorites Due your reading and participate and she will love you 
Make sure you do your first assignments really well because she likes to grade all you do in the future based on your first work If she likes you the class can be interesting even if it drags on sometimes 
She is so nice and funny Spanish  just as compconvo is boring in general but she was awesome Shes super funny and speaks quickly and its great practice to hear a fast native speaker its easy to catch on I would definitely recommend her 
She is very sweet and adorable but her class can be unnecessarily difficult There was a significant difference between Spanish  and  She only allows one interpretation and she is not very tolerant of students who skip the readings even if for only one night Overall nice but too tough for a core requirement class 
I felt like she picked favorites in the class Shell call you out big time if SHE thinks you didnt do the work even if you did do it 
Teresa Marcelin is the nicest professor Ive had at Tufts Her lectures can be a little scattered and unorganized but she does well at keeping the class engaged and is sometimes hilarious 
Lots of busywork but thats not really her fault its the departments Super pleasant and helpful will correct all of your grammar mistakes but not a particularly hard grader

Dr Olfert is very nice and knowledgeable and there is a good balance of lecture and interactive discussion in her class She is also very helpful in office hours and wants to make sure the students understand the material I would definitely recommend this class with her 
AMAZING professor Intelligent kind and genuinely concerned with her students progress The class was interesting inspirational and really opened my mind to a lot of new ideas One of the best coursesprofessors at Tufts

Cried literal tears after my class with Ammons ended Take Earth Matters Now Yesterday Whenever Just take it 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
Hated the class Ammons constantly shuts down and interrupts students who disagree with her point of view and basically uses the class to push a political agenda rather than teaching She only assigns readings that agree with her point of view and never opens anything up for true debate or discussion The class was useless and a waste of time 
She is incredibly intelligent enthusiastic and very concerned with her students progress and getting them engaged with the material She teaches us not only english as it relates to the literary aesthetic but also to our own lives now in  AMAZING 
I have never had a professor who cared so much about inspiring me and guiding my work to be the best it could be She has helped me to be an active thinker and to push me in the direction of broadening my perception of the American canon 
Great professor great class and extremely helpful 
the greatest professor at tufts sincere articulate challenging proponent of social activism brings snacks to class and writes exclamation points and smilies all over papersa sheer joy 
Ammons is greatly enthusiastic about the class She also does her best to make the material easy for her students I highly recommend taking American Indian Writers with her Theres a final exam and a research paper plus weekly journals Very straightforward 
Very intelligent woman and interesting lecturer however has a tendency to bring EVERYTHING back to race which limits class discussion and papers Also needs to check her personal politics at the door But she does a great job of relating th century texts to today eyeopening and overall worthwhile course 
Probably one of the best professors I have had So intelligent and helpful both inside and out of class 
very political but also very openminded shes an incredible social and political critic incredibly wellread 
American Lit to  FIELD TRIPS For a lit class she didnt assign an unreasonable amount of work Prof Ammons made the class interesting instead of just lecturing at us everyday The major paper assignments were more creative than the usual empirical essays Smart and reasonable prof

If you want your perspective on the world to be changed take this class If youre a hardcore STEM person I would not encourage you to take this class Ammons is beyond amazing she just takes a very strongly leftleaning view on the topics 
The BEST If you love English and the humanities take this class Fun discussion based intellectual and not too difficult Ammons is the best professor I have had at Tufts She is amazing 
Professor McL is definitely one of the best professors here she is so excited about the material and cares about her students understanding it Despite all the complaints about this course SHE DID A GREAT JOB I will take more classes with her next year

Just finished my senior year and this was the BEST class I took during my time at Tufts I learned so much and loved every second of it 
I really did not like this professor She expects everyone to do well and if you go to see her for help she makes you feel useless and is really rude about it 
She is a very dynamic professor  that really knows her stuff I am not even a biology major  and I LOVED her section of this lab course I would take another course with her in a second

Prof Mclaughlin is my favorite lecturer in the bio department Very focused and direct open to questions and class participation 
BEST CLASS AT TUFTS this is a great professor  i wish she taught more classes and they stopped wasting her time in BIO  they dont appreciate her in that course  SHE WAS GREAT and the reason I got into grad school

Prof McGlaughlin gave a guest lecture at my school recently and she was amazing She really had the entire room at the edge of their seats A very engaging speaker She really knew her stuff but was able to make the content accessible to everyone in the room I would love to sit in on one of her classes someday 
Prof McGlaughlin is great Her course is difficultbut this is collegeit should be a college level class I got a B and worked very hard for that grade Best class I have taken yetand I am a postbac so I have taken a lot of classes over the years She meets with students outside of class to help them understand the materialgood class 
Very clear knowledgeable and friendly Awesome and helpful during office hours so go to them 
Her lectures are flawless and engaging She is brilliant but not egocentric which makes her so likeable She wants students to succeed so she doesnt throw any curveballs Loved the final project creating a video

BEST PERSON EVER take a class with her if you can Because of her I got an amazing job this fall 
I love the fact that someone posted about Dr McL for a class she doesnt teach she doesnt teach bio In any case bio is a great class It is challenging  what you would expect for a college level course It is NOT a weedout course  folks that say it is are just upset because they didnt get an A Take it and judge for yourself 
Im not sure how people liked herespecially after meeting with her for help She puts you on the spot and is definitely a proponent of making Bio a weedout type class She teaches Darwinian style  survival of the fittest and if you aint fit you get a C regardless of how smart you are or how knowledgeable you are about biology in general

Prof Mclaughlin was excellent Her lectures were clear and well organized She made us really think about the material  her lectures were interactive and I looked forward to going to class She is by far the best professor in the biology department She also really cares about her students and is super funny 
She was amazing During office hours she really helped me understand concepts and her lectures were lively and well presented 
Dr McLaughlin is a very talented and caring teacher She has spent endless hours helping me understand the material  and is one of the most enthusiastic faculty members I have had a Tufts thus far I am a junior now I think people in the intro class need to start doing some work and stop blaming other people for their shortcomings 
shes animated intelligent and interesting shes really into what she does and encourages students to think creatively and figure things out for themselves 
Bio  is hard but not as hard as people claim it is and Dr McLaughlin was a big help in building my mastery of the material Her lectures cover some tough material but if you ask questions she is more than happy to help Also she clearly remembers her students as she helped show me around the bio major after the class ended 
Cebe is a great professor and Optics is one of the best classes Ive taken at Tufts If youve seen wavesfourier series before the class is a blast If you havent it will be very challenging but totally worth it Cebe loves to help you outside class and is incredibly charismatic about optics 
Professor Cebe truly cares about the well being of her students However she teaches just a small portion of the material required to take an exam Personally I truly disliked the class 
I was not strong in physics before I took this class so I struggled a lot and Cebe didnt help what so ever Her lectures were scattered she messed up proofs during lecture and was useless when I met with her one on one Scared my physics experience 
Not the most exciting professor She goes over what you need to know but often she is unable to explain things in a different way for people who dont understand the first She also isnt always good at understanding students questions Shes kind enough though has a sense of humor and prepares you well enough for the tests 
Cebe is a professor who loves her field of study and definitely cares about her students progress I had trouble following her lectures though She tended to gloss over basic or fundamental concepts and spend too much time on complicated integrals for an intro course Overall I found her to be a good teacher 
Cebe is the best she says funny things but i dont think she realizes it also shes hot but really the class is pretty tough especially if you didnt have much physics in high school but i feel pretty confident that ill be ready for physics  now 
She is definitely very helpful I went to ask her questions every week even twice sometimes and she never complained about it Whenever you have a question she is very willing to help you But this is a fast paced course So you should keep track of what she has done before it is too late

I took Biophysics with her last semester and it was probably my favorite class the entire year A lot of what we learned was simplified versions of real phenomena but you still got a lot out of it She always took part of a class day to basically go over the hard homework problems Reading the chapters before doing homework is a must 
Very straightforward lectures pretty intense with the math very challenging class She definitely is helpful outside of class very nice 
Cebes teaching is semiclear and uninspiring Also she teaches straight from the math and expects you to figure out most of the conceptual stuff on your own Careful about asking questions if its not a good one she might bite But talk to her after class and shes very willing to help 
She is a fair teacher I would recommend reading the textbook before class because she moves fast I had limiting physics before this class so it was hard but if you spend time trying to understand the concepts and applying them youll be fine 
Cebes awesome Shes got a sense of humor and she cares about her students 
It was hard for her to connect with students who had never been exposed to physics before 
I used to have a strong interest in physics before taking this class Cebe does not care what grade you get as long as you pass Dont expect a scale She spends way too much time on obscure stuff than fundamentals She makes her tests out of  points and takes off  points for calculator errors clearly doesnt want us to do well at all 
An intro class of  students is not the ideal situation for learning but Professor Cebe did her best She has clear lecture notes if you sit in the first couple row and force yourself to pay attention She easily gets thrown off by other perspectives on thought questions Tests are hard but not impossible if you do lots of extra book problems 
Ohhhh Cebe Sometimes ya just gotta laugh shes pretty odd and her lectures arent particularly compelling It really helped that I had taken Physics as an AP The tests are straightforward and doable with some studying she gives study guides that prepare you well Just a pretty dry introductory class Thats the way it goes 
Ive had Professor Stafford for Comp and Comp Her lectures cover what you need to know in order to chug through labs and assignments Show up to lecture and take good notes and you will not have to kill yourself reading the book She isnt easy or hard just straight forward Know what she covers in lecture and your way good 
Very stressful class lots of work vague lectures Had to teach myself everything out of the textbook and rely on TAs for assistance I would avoid taking this class with her if possible 
Lectures are rather straightforward and the tests are straight from the textbook Students find this class hard if they dont get outside help if you go the TAs during office hours as well as read the book the class is actually quite easy Oh and start on the project before the day its due 
I was also in  with the previous poster Its true she was a really miserable teacher Stafford obviously didnt care about her students responded to questions like they were personal attacks and didnt understand her own poorly written powerpoints that were the center of her lectures Avoid if at all possible 
The classes Ive had with her have been awful She bores the class with powerpoints that she doesnt really understand which are also full of typos Everybody in Comp  agreed that it was awful but nobody else posted here maybe they just wanted to forget about it Stafford is a nice lady but a completely useless teacher 
Lectures were extremely boring and way more was expected of us than was taught Expect to selfteach almost all material Basically a waste of time avoid this class at all costs 
Literally the worst class ive ever taken Lectures are extremely worthless unclear and so unhelpful 
Class sessions were sometimes just review of the text but her clarifications were always very helpful For an intro class she might have given us too much credit for being able to understand the assignements on our own but thats not necessarily a bad thing 
Caring helpful simply the best 
Extremely kind She is very helpful and cares very much about her students Class is difficult for beginners and moves fast you will have to work hard to do well

A really nice and positive teacher who actually cares 
Shes a very nice lady but the amount of homework she assigns is ridiculous and I am not new to latin If you have never taken Latin be warned because it will not be easy especially if you are just taking it to fill the language requirement and arent really into it 
Shes a sweet lady but handles us like were in kindergarten Its frustrating I would have liked Latin a lot more if I didnt constantly feel pandered to 
Elementary Latin I  Setnik is extremely helpful and enthusiastic The course is fast paced but thorough Its traditional and by the book and your grade is determined mostly by exams which fortunately are pretty easy Its not especially interesting because its an intro course but if you want to learn Latin then take this course and you will 
She is the nicest prof Ive ever had She cares a lot about her students and tries to make class fun She is always willing to help and the classes were pretty easy You really have to do your homework in order to make it through class and do well on tests 
worst economics class ive taken at tufts there is no point in going to class just self study 
No point in going to class since its easier to just teach everything yourself but her tests are really easy and her problem sets arent too bad She gives out the previous two years exams so figuring out what kind of questions shell ask on your exam is really simple The median on the first midterm in my class was a  An easy  level class 
She explains things thoroughly and writes everything out on the board Her midterms are easy just study the practice exams she provides Problem sets are straight forward and she is always up to helping you outside of class

Dont waste your money on the textbook  there are never assignments in it and she only suggests it ever as a reference It is rarely helpful

Prof Menegotto is passionate about what she teaches but she can prove difficult to follow and to understand She sometimes scribbles formulas and numbers on the board without really explaining what and why she is writing and then asks if there are questions which can be extremely confusing She very available and will help you if she can 
I got a B in EC and literally  on menegottos first midterm Youll freak out studying and then take the test and be like was that it Shes kindof hard to understand because of her accent but she actually teaches you what she tests you on No tricks Highly suggested 
I took this class after i saw all the amazing comments and I dont know what everyone was thinking She talks nonstop every class and nobody understands her with her accent She is very helpful with problem set which are impossible and exams which arent too bad If she is the easiest id be terrified of other teachers

Professor Thomas is awesome Her research on memory cognition and aging is SUPER interesting and she always incorporates interesting and relevant examples from her research into the class Tests were challenging but if you put in a little extra study time they were manageable and fair Im totally declaring a psych major 
Thomas is a terrible psych professor Her lectures are unclear filled with typos and shell waste class time talking about herself The exam she gave was poorly written and she was of no help when it came to asking questions about what material to study Avoid her at all costs

Not many positive things to say She sometimes tries to be funny and mostly seems to enjoy teaching However she is pompous and overbearing She clearly does not always know her topic I did not enjoy when she taught the class Tests were too hard and there were many drops Absolutely loved the material but would not take again because of her

Naginski is a really nice professor She talks slowly as she is getting old so it sometimes gets a little tedious if youre tired However essays are nearly guaranteed As as she corrects them then you have the chance to put in her corrections and submit it again and shell give you full marks Very knowledgeable and inspiring 
Not the most entertaining class ever but everything was pretty much fair and clear 
Nice made class enjoyable especially when trying to stuff entire semester of learning into second summer term 
She will put you down if you have a different opinion or dont know the answer She asks weird questions like what is the most important word and the answer is obscure like the word is If you dont know the year of the Fr revolution she thinks you are dumb Grading is manageable because you can write as many drafts as you like 
Prof Naginski surprised me with her indepth knowledge of the private and public world of the th century literati in France By giving us a detailed view of the th century political and social ideal she made the stories all the more interesting to read Very supportive and enthusiastic I recommend you take any of her classes 
Extremely helpful very good at explaining conceptsetc and genuinely cares about her students and their progress I would highly recommend taking a class with her 
Its true about the mood swings Shes mostly a very sweet lady but will sometimes freak out on you which I found completely inappropriate for a professor 
Dora Older was the sweetest teacher I have ever met I thought I would be absolutely miserable in an am Spanish class but she brought energy music and candy into class I am abysmal at Spanish but she is an easy grader so I got an A I always felt comfortable in her class when normally I am overwhelmed in language courses 
I have extremely mixed feelings about this professor At times she can be sweet and helpful However I must admit that the majority of the time I felt her attitude to be patronizing and intimidating She would often yell at the students while they were trying to speak and is extremely intolerant of error In the end I was offended and apathetic 
I had a class with her at  including Fridays yet she still made it tolerable with her energy and overall kindness towards the class Expect a boombox candy and the occassional donut She genuinely cares whether you understand the material or not Go to her office hours and youll be one of her favorites 
Dora really is fantastic She came to our  class singining and dancing to the spanish music she blasted from her stereo and offering us a plate of chocolates A great class I feel that conversationally my spanish improved greatlyShe does have some weird mood swings where she gets a little angry or grumpy but overall shes really wonderful 
Excellent professor She was able to make a pretty cut and dry subject interesting and she genuinely cares about all of her students Shes also such an amazing and kind person you cant help but like her

INSPIRATIONAL 
 She has a black belt  She gives you candy almost every class  Shes the sweetest spanish teacher Ive ever had  Id trade my grandma for her I took Spanish because I had to but it ended up being my favorite class because she is just such a sweet lady 
She is awesome Best Spanish teacher I have had so far and Ive had a lot The fact that she comes in each morning bumping music on her little boombox makes my day Very passionate about what she does and enthusiastic 
Professor Older is amazing Shows absolute enthusiasm and is always available to seek out There is a decent amount of work but is quite accommodating She knows the material and teachers it well I would recommend taking the class with her even though it is at an early time 
Senora Older is a really fun teacher She walks into class with a boom box on her shoulder every morning She is also very helpful and you learn a lot without feeling overwhelmed Definitely the best Spanish teacher Ive had so far 
I really didnt like Spanish to begin with just taking it to be done with the distribution requirements but she made the class moderately enjoyable Shes adorable more like aDORAble amirite quite sassy when she wants to be and overall a very pleasant person 
Awesome teacher very enthusiastic and will give you a good grade if you participate in class and show interest Work is not too hard exams are difficult but she grades easily 
Profesora Older is good at what she does Though the comments about the mood swings are true I generally found her to be happy and pleasant Shes quite helpful if you want to go over a test which I recommend doing Just make sure you do the homework and speak a bit in class and youll have a good time 
She is an amazing profesora with truly loves what she is teaching She is always helpful and available outside of class She really wants all her students to get an A 
Professor Older definitely did the best she could with the otherwise lessthanexciting course material mostly review of Spanish  I was lucky to have her in a small class setting which made it easy to get to know her She really cares about her students and goes out of her way to help you whenever you she can Great professor 
Senora Older is great She is always cheerful patient and extremely helpful The best language teacher Ive had

This is the best class and best professor i have had at Tufts She is so inspirational funny accessible and made me fall in love with architectural history 
RESPECTED 
AMAZING LECTURES 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
Prof Martinez is amazing I learned so much about architecture in just one semester Her lectures are so indepth that you dont really need to do readings however they may help you better understand course content Very accessible and grades easily if you pay attention to her expectations for the assignment Best professor Ive had at Tufts 
She didnt actually teach anything she just copied stuff out of the book onto the board Complete waste of time the only reason to go is to pass in homework 
While she sometimes be confusing in class she is extremely helpful during office hours She genuinely cares about her students I would take her class again 
I dread going to this class She is really unorganized and springs random useless asssignments on you because she thinks they are fun and a good idea She is a very very nice and sweet woman though Prior to this class I use to like spanish and get good grades in it But she has a strange grading system 
Shes an extremely nice woman and a very good teacher She makes spanish enjoyable She does send you a lot of work but so does every spanish  teacher it seems to be mandated by the department I would recommend her 
Extremely kind woman very good teacher Wants students to do well Just put in a little effort 
She is a little unorganized but once you get the hang of how the class goes and what she expects from students than it is very easy to do well She is also a very sweet woman and definitely wants students to do well 
Professor WegelHajj is very nice but very scatterbrained She never made it through all of the topics for the day leaving her students with even more work on top of the immense workload from the syllabus Very generous with corrections and retakes though Assumes students will understand grammar points with only brief explanation 
WegelHajj is disorganized and all over the place She tries and cares about the students but her class is boring and unhelpful A lot of the material i had to learn on my own before the tests Its easy to get an A i think 
I could not stand this woman Though she was super nice she was the most disorganized unhelpful person Ive ever come across Gr 
Shes a really nice woman who keeps Spanish from being completely boring A relatively entertaining class considering the subject matter 
i just have to say she is a nice woman who teaches a horrible subject Spanish  sux get over it it sux no matter who you have Very very nice lets you turn in late a good teacher in a bad class 
She is very friendly wont embarrass you in class and you can get away with doing very little work You wont be prepared for tests unless you study a lot andor do all the assignments but the course is an enormous amount of work much more than Spanish  and  
Absolutely terrific Boatload of work but as is par for all spanish  Loves having you go see her for office hours and is genuinely one of the sweetest professors at the school 
Anna is very caring but extremely disorganized We never followed the syllabus because wed never finish what we were supposed to get to in class adding more work and material to cover in the next She wants you to do well and is very generous with corrections and makeups but expects you to follow along with her scattered lesson plans 
She is a very nice woman but not a good teacher Yes she may be easy but she does not motivate you to learn which is the mark of a good teacher Our classtime was often spent doing exercises in the book with classmates that we already did the night before for hw I didnt learn anything 
Very kind prof Really wants her students to succeed Willing to work w you offers extra credit extensions etc to ensure it However she is also always late and losing papers Disorganized and scatter brained If youre type A find someone else Otherwise shes the best 
She is a grad student The testshomework are created by the course coordinator and not her I was leery of a grad student but sat in on all the sections and her lecture was the best Did lots of examples in class and review sessions Extremely accessible out of the class and she will make sure you understand the material You cant ask for more

SO MANY PAPERS 
Prof Aymer is a sweet person but honestly doesnt run a classroom well I took Sociology  and all lectures were very boring She is very disorganized grades intensely and you wont know your grade until the end of the semester She has a hard time accepting other view points and can be stubborn in conversation Wouldnt recommend her class 
Professor Aymer is well she was okay The assignments were someone unclear sometimes and as a result they made the class harder than they should have been She made us do grammar exercises during class which was not cool Overall the class was fine and she knows her material but somewhat of a boring lecturer 
Aymer as a professor is aggressively average The subject matter was dulled through boring lecture and little classroom involvement She knows her subject but is resistant to hearing other opinions and incorporating them into class discussion makes sweeping generalizations about young folksSyllabus unclear each week is a guessing game 
she enjoys what she is teaching but surprisingly has very little grasp on the material a course that should have focused on the rd world stayed mostly in the contiguous states she has also has no tolerance for views that dont coincide with her own 
Fabulously interesting material but she can be all over the place Gives assignments at the last minute and assignments are not very clear Shes a little crazy but the class is very interesting 
I found her lectures stimulating and thematically organized I have a limited background in the subject matter and found her lectures illuminating in a scholarly way You have to pull your wieght as a student and come prepared and willing to absorb a whole new worldview I found her analysis helpful analutiticalk wrob ling dn dupuhoxturaet 
I learned quite a bit in this class However lectures tend to go slowly and she repeats a lot of the material because she is convinced that we arent getting it which is frustrating Sometimes she isnt very clear as to what she wants  in class papers several reading responses and a final  page research paper 
Very boring class the prof is not good at keeping things interesting and is pretty unclear about grading It was pretty easy however if you can stay awake 
I took Racial and Ethnic Minorities with her The class hit on the the key points as well as answering big questions about the sociology and conception of racial identities in America Overall a great class worth taking 
Prof Aymer is a solid teacher Course load is manageable page paper due every week  quizes  final paper Material is interesting expanding our view of what is a family Shes very articulate and funny when she slips up and hints at her own opinion on material or tells anecdotal stories 
Sociology of Religion Spring  This class was interesting although I think that a more apt title would be Fundamentalism in the Modern World She was a fair grader although somewhat vague on prompts If you enjoy anecdotes told with a Caribbean accent then youll enjoy this class 
Took intro to Immigration with her shes very unorganized and very unclear with her syllabus every week was a guessing game she gets a bit miffed when the students point out certain things that are wrong about the syllabus To be fair though she knows her stuff and she will help you if you ask 
Aymer is a sweetheart but if you are looking for a class that surveys a variety of religions with clear lectures that follow a logical flow do not take this I learned a lot about fundamentalist religions and I was able to absorb a lot from her lectures if I was in the right mindset honestly smoke a j before it helps Shes great but unorganized 
Prof Aymer is fun and passionate but a bit nutty and can be harsh when you dont do well on assignments though thats usually because the assignment was unclear or didnt reflect course material and she can be a tough grader I like her but shes hard to deal with Class material is interesting 
Panetta is hilarious but her class is challenging She is an amazing teacher who will help you extensively if you are having trouble Get to know her  she is a great connection to have and a nice person 
avoid at all costs shes the worst prof in electrical engineering department had no idea what was going on in ee and went to another professors class and took notes classes were completely disorganized and she often skipped class  let us out early because she didnt know the material

INSPIRATIONAL 
RESPECTED 
Dean Panetta is a wonderful professor and incredibly inspirational Unfortunately people mistake her knowledge and humor to arrogance The class is easy all you need to do is follow the lectures carefully and do all the assignments She does not give lecture notes but the text book and inclass lectures are more than sufficient 
She wasnt that bad but the TAs were no help at all and overly critical 
Worst teacher Ive ever had 
Very clear lectures Lots of work Panetta is a great professor but is a bit arrogant and rubs a lot of people the wrong way But certainly from an academic standpoint Panetta is one of the best professors at Tufts 
RESPECTED 
INSPIRATIONAL 
Her lectures are fantastic and shes always happy to clarify or help There are few female engineering professors and its nice to have such a great inspiration She can be a little curt and she has said a couple problematic things but for the most part she is awesome 
GROUP PROJECTS 
Dean Panetta is a good lecturer but the course was very poorly run Part of this has to do with the fact that she was running it in conjunction with another professor but there were lots of administrative things that she was just not aware of When we asked her about the homework it was typically the st time she had seen it 
Panetta is good teacher Her lectures are focused and clear The main problem with this class is that it consumes way too much time Though there are few labs the prelabs and writeups are both time consuming and tedious the final project will require you to live in the lab for the last  weeks of class Exams are long they cover everything 
Karen is the best professor in this department For any student looking for a perspective on the real world after college Karen provides it She cares about her students and is a great contact for job opportunities later on No one should miss her class 
TOUGH GRADER 
GET READY TO READ 
Panetta is very arrogant to her students It is next to impossible to get in contact with Panetta as she NEVER replies to your emails and her schedule is always so full that you have to make an appointment to talk to her almost  weeks in advance She also with absolutely no exceptions offer no leniency on late assignments or test retakes  
Panetta is a fantastic professor She conveys the subject material very well cares about her students understanding and will help you if you seek her aid She has also been solely responsible for getting me three internships that then helped me get into graduate school Highly recommended 
Good challenging class However you put yourself at a big disadvantage if you dont attend her office hours 
If you get to know her she will go to the ends of the earth to ensure your sucess in her class and in the future 
Fun courses but you dont learn anything 
Panettas class is interesting to me Besides the content of the class she as a professor can be very arrogant at times I know a lot of kids who are rubbed the wrong way by her She can be at times organized and other times not organized at all 
Panetta is a pretty good but challenging professor She preaches professionalism but lacks quite a bit herself often failing to return phone calls or emails Her TAs reflected her poor organization and while the course content is interesting and farily wellpresented over all she lacks the professionalism she claims to teach frustrating 
Most helpful Prof ive had Got me two interviews and an internship Very helpful and always VERY fair willing to regrade anything and very generous with extra credit Anyone who didnt do well has only themselves to blame 
Felice has a lot of experience in the field and has a lot to teach A little more work than other sections but its worth it Put in the work and you will get a good grade 
She does not have her act together Conflicting dates vague assignments and a lack of academic focus prevent Felice from reaching her students 
Prof is a bit spacey can be good eg forgets if you hand in assignments late however does not teach particularly well penalized students for points judges brought up but she did not recognize her self take for easy pass but demonstrate improvement in the class 
SO unorganized She had conflicting dates in her syllabus and it was just really unclear in general She was terrible at explaining what she expected in our assignments and still couldnt figure out why no one ever knew what was due so she had to send out a weekly email And on top she was a hard grader on the final project 
Jackie was an absolutely outstanding professor I took her class in the ExCollege on Infinite Jest and I enjoyed it a lot Being in the classroom for two and a half hours was never torturous work was never overwhelming and the difficulty of the text was never imposing because I could always expect a lucid explanation on Monday Would recommend 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
She cannot lecture for her life If being a professor just means reading off of a slideshow then why dont I teach the class Also her tests are literal torture and require brute memorization or solely reading comprehension She makes the phrase Biology is the history of STEM true 
GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK 
TEST HEAVY 
LECTURE HEAVY 
reads off the slides but shes made it clear that its bc she wants the slides to be an exact study guide of what will be on the exam Plus she verbally describes it in a different way than the slides so that the info is presented twice repetitive review of material makes exams super easy print lectures before class and annotate to maximize time 
Very nice funny passionate Minimal homework labs are easy Studying for tests can be time consuming but if you know the material really well then its definitely possible to do well

Norah is an awesome professor Shes really passionate about her field and you can see that through her lectures and in her office hours Because shes so excited to share her knowledge she speeds through a lot of content and talks really fast Rewatching and annotating her lectures is a helpful way to study for her exams 
She was entirely uninterested in the class and directly refused any contact with students outside of classtime The only good part of the class was that it got to me to write  story 
Shes all about helping students figure it out for themselves Her class wasnt very structured but her book is worth the buy and her constructive criticism takes your work leaps and bounds 
Haters here need to go away I was struggling with my short story and she literally helped me until I understood the fundamentals to writing fiction so much better She doesnt give much work Quizzes and assignments are nothing half of them arent even checked and so work on your story and ASK FOR HELP SHE WILL AND SHES ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU 
I had Sybil at Emerson I was just thinking about her tonight and no not in that way I think she came to mind because I was lineediting my fiction earlier and was impressed with my marks on the pagethis I learned from her an amazing lineeditor She was just lovely so honest but so kind It was great fortune to have been taught by her 
Sybz is great She has her opinions and you should abide by them for a good grade but shes smart and talented so I was okay with that 
Im a better creative writer Go figure 
I found class incredibly boring as peer edited every week for three hours She gave okay feedback on stories but was very opinionated even though they were our own stories I did not appreciate how we had to purchase the  textbook on Amazon that she wrote only to use it like three times for quizzes that did nothing to further my learning 
Very unstructured and the classes themselves were incredibly boring because we took turns reading short stories of the textbook a complete waste of time Her comments and edits were helpful however Just show effort in the class and make sure you write your drafts on time and at least with some length and almost guaranteed an A

If you follow guidelines you WILL get an A in this class She told us we would have quizzes but we never had one Our grade was  creative writing story we worked on all semester I have minimal writing experience and found this class extremely easy Sibyl is VERY approachable and gives a ton of feedback 
Will work with you in whatever capacity for CWR but class wasnt structured enough for my taste Did end up writing a good story though She is kind of spacyvague and her teaching style wasnt that inspiring 
This class is great to take if youve never tried creative writing before She basically tells you exactly what you need to do to get an A and the workload is minimal The class size is small  around   and its fun getting to know the other writers in your class I left this class with a greater appreciation for the writing process

Sybil is very sweet a motherly presence in the classroom She offers great feedback but doesnt dig for flaws if youre producing quality work She truly believes in the workshop model and will rarely talk over or disagree with other students feedback even if hers isnt the same Open to genre writing if you keep the focus on the characters 
Fairly easy but Johnston is completely biased which in an intro creative writing class is ridiculous If your final result wasnt exactly what she wanted she lowered your grade She gave little feedback on our work and put even less effort into helping students improve their writing style Also if you write genre fiction dont take Johnston 
Really helpful and informative You get to play games and do activities for the second half of class and the tests arent too hard 
Very fun class She is laid back and insightful 
Very clear and helpful with a lot of insight her TA was good too 
excellent professor very helpful 
Very clear lecturer can be dry at some points however to me its expected with cognitive psychology Has a genuine interest in teaching and really cares for students 
She is absolutely amazing by far the best professor I have ever had Her classes are engaging and her lectures are well organized with grade visual aids She cares more about her students than I have ever encountered with any teacher in my life Everyone should take a class with her 
shes awesome 
Awesome class and professor Lots of class discussion lectures are interesting and she does a great job of tying all of the reading theres a lot of it together Professor Jackson couldnt be nicer and I would take another class with her in a heartbeat 
Shes a great professor and very good at moving discussions The course material was interesting she knows her stuff and you definitely learn a lot 
Professor Jackson is brilliant and inspiring She encourages and appreciates class participation Lot of reading but great class

Really great professor Im not particularly interested in American literature but taking American Lit with her made me love it She is brilliant dynamic interesting and an engaging lecturer 
I LOVE HAVA take Heb  even if you dont want to learn it just to have her as a teacher She is so sweet and only cares about her students I wish that I could have her every semester 
She is the nicest woman on campus Also HOTT as HELL Youll find it hard to concentrate on the Hebrew because she is SO FREAKING GORGEOUS Get ready to be amazed by her hotness Seriously 
Hava is a really nice woman who will give you as much extra help as you need Not hard to do well but not class is mandatory and meets often If you try you will do well 
without a doubt the nicest and most caring professor at tufts the class isnt hard and she is very concerned with everyones progress if you do the homework only takes about half an hour a night it isnt hard to get an A 
She is sooo easy and class is like a middle school class She is also really clear and sooo sweet You actually learn Hebrew in a cozy relaxed environment 
Hava is AWESOME Shes really a great Hebrew teacher especially for beginners At the end of the semester I was amazed by how much I had learned and its all thanks to Hava She always insists on helping you even if you dont want help and acts very maternal while youre in her class which is good and sometimes hilarious 
Hava is the nicest most caring most qualified and sweetest language professor at Tufts and known outside as well She is very concerned with her students progress and teaches very well She is pretty and cute a little motherly in the good way and very fun to take 
Great class She moves at a slow pace and the workload is very light maybe the norm for an intro language class Yet the overall reason to take this class is Hava Not only is she very clear she cares so sincerely about your individual progress and makes a real effort to know you 
This is a pretty good class The work and tests were easy and the teacher is very helpful and just wants everyone to do well Shes also supposedly much better than the other Hebrew  teacher If you are taking this class take it with this professor

I loved Chemistry before taking this class but after taking her class I dislike it  I heard it was going to be easy but it is THE worst class I have ever taken She does not explain anything and the book is just as bad I bought a different chem book and used that to teach myself the material Beware 
This class SUCKS but if you already know the material youll be able to get through Shes a TERRIBLE teacher wrote the WORST book Ive ever read seriously  the book is still in alpha stages and she forces us to use it You learn nothing in class 
Doesnt teach class in a way conducive to note taking Exams can be tricky 
The first day she asks you as a class if you know what HO is You are treated like  years olds from then on She has a poor method of teaching and she wrote the book for the class Yea Its tough Some ups to the class are  is an A  is a B Unless you know someone who has gone through the class already avoid it 
basically tries to be the quirky brilliant professoris kinda wierd gives the most random tests not covered in her stupid DIY book her book sucks the exams are sorta related to the material in classgave a low grade 
Shultz is absolutely the worst professor that Ive had thus far Her lectures not germane at all to test content and homework assignments She is absentminded and incapable of teaching even the most basic concepts of chemistry Avoid her class take CHEM  
She is a very nice person but is unable to teach even the basic concepts that are required to even begin learning chemistry I took CHEM as an alternative to CHEM and was expecting a breeze through but the workload was way more than anyone predicted 
This was the worst class that I have ever taken The book is HORRIBLE I became so frustrated with the book I went out and bought another one Avoid this class at all costs 
very high on herself wrote the textbook worst book i ever used 
unclear teaching style wrote the text for the class which might be the worst thing ive ever set eyes on Lectures are structured poorly homework assignments are often due before material in question is taught 
Incompetent professor Material is very nonstandard compared to chem  and she doesnt teach it well Hard to understand lecturestextbook which she wrote Quizzes not AT ALL representative of study guides which was very disappointing led to class arguments regarding quiz material Median jumps from  to  and she refuses to curve grades 
Prof Shultz is the worst professor I have had so far I usually do not give prof ratings unless I feel strongly about himher but if you read the rest of comments below youll understand Disjunct lectures hardtounderstand textbook Quizzes are VERY hard to study forher study guides are dangerously misleading I would go for Chem  instead 
Great Professor Really knows her stuff Passionate about Cognitive Science Managed to make it really clear and accessible even though the subject is hard I had no idea there was so much to know about the brain Fair midterm grade Best class I have taken at Tufts 
The lectures were pretty interesting but she was very disorgainzed as a professor and kind of spastic The tests were fairly hard but the TA graded them so easily that everybody got high grades Interesting class but kind of a waste of time 
Dr Kuperberg drones on for a long  and a half hours and while the material of the class if very interesting and compelling it is impossible to sit through this class without developing a migraine headache She is very fair with grades and is quite smart however that doesnt make up for the fact that her lectures are incredibly dull and boring 
What a fantastic professor The lectures were organized so interesting and informative She brings such deep knowledge to this class I felt inspired after every class I just saw the comments of the student before me What a fool heshe is and how ironic that a student used the degrading and insensitive word of spastic to describe abn psych 
LECTURE HEAVY 
INSPIRATIONAL 
Dr Kuperberg is likely one of the smartest professors at Tufts and this comes across clearly or for some unclearly in her lectures Psych  has a  hour lecture but if you can both sit still for that long and are able to match her intellect the course will be one of the most valuable offered to you if you want to go into cognitive science 
Dr Kuperberg is by far the most inspiring professor I have had thus far at Tufts She has such a passion for what she does and is able to lecture on the field of cognitive science in a way that is clear and concise If you cant sit still or keep yourself from going on Facebook while taking notes on your laptop then long lectures arent for you 
Sure this was a  and a half hour lecture class but she makes it the most boring  and a half hours you will ever have Prior to taking the class I was both interested and excited Now Im slightly disappointed that I really dreaded going Shes very intelligent but she is not meant to be a teacher 
Great Professor Slides were well organized and tests werent too difficult if you studied all the slidesClass was a bit dull at the beginning but got much more interesting towards the end

Professor Emerson is so brilliant that I remembered watching her get lost in her own sentences because of their complexity She really makes you feel smart when she appreciates your work  she knows her stuff 
Professor Emerson is a super nice woman who really cares about her students and is interested in their work in and outside of class but if you dont share her interests it is difficult to really connect to her and get a lot out of her class Her class was pretty unstructured and I dont feel like I actually learned anything from it 
She changed my life no doubt about it Now Im a professor and can only aspire to do what she did

Very nice and caring helpful open to suggestions A lot of reading though and yes you should have some interest in education though Sometimes class seems a bit slow but shes such a sweet person

very dedicated excellent teacher 
Nancy Bauer is one of the smartest professors at Tufts yet remains incredibly humble and approachable If you have the chance definitely take her class Feminist Philosophy She is a genius and should win every prize in the world She is an academic powerhouse that you also wish was your best friend 
Nancy is amazing Very articulate engaging and passionate about the subject The readings were all the important readings youd want to have and the assignments were fair relevant and interesting Fabulous class 
Professor Bauer was AMAZING I loved her class She is fascinating and intelligent and I cant wait to take another class with her She will make you think so much in the best possible way Definitely take her Feminist Philosophy class 
Great professor truly interested and cares about the material and her students wether she knows you personally or not Really warm and friendly believes in the importance of philosophy etc However Im a little angry that I recieved a B after getting As on all the essayshow does that happen 
great professor makes a big lecture seem like a small class 
I graduated a year ago and i still think about how great her Intro to Ethics class was Great role model great teacher great all around 
this woman is a gifted thinker teacher and isnt socially autistic in fact shes incredibly cool best thing is youll learn how to write 
Prof Bauer focuses on her students learning the material and not on grades She is cool but the use of movies takes away from our understanding of the already difficult ethicist philosophies Grading may be fair but is very tough 
nancy is the best her classes are greatshe shows so much passion for the materialits a pleasure being in her class 
amazing professor incredibly intelligent take every class she teaches 
Amazing teacher Her lectures were always very interesting and emphasizes more of what you think rather than focusing on grades Great class 
Nancy Bauers Intro to Ethics class was the most pointless class I have taken at Tufts She goes through the readings incredibly slowly and explains them condescendingly so that any interest one might have in the material is destroyed by her lectures She gave me headaches It is very easy though 
Upholds philosophy departments amazing reputation Take this course both easy and extremely informative 
She was helpful knowledgeable and the class was fun Too much readings though 
challenging but very helpful and knowledgeable 
Seems as though she was learning material along with students Difficulty explaining content Assignments were good although too much emphasis placed on research

Lizzie is really great She gives really helpful advice and genuinely cares about her students progress Shes super sweet and responsive to what her students want to do She likes to do a lot of demos and art slideshows which kind of annoyed me because I just wanted to paint but they are actually helpful in the long run

Honored to have learned from Lizi TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES you will love her The supplies on her syllabus are kinda expensive but you dont need everything Plus she and students always are kind enough to share supplies She assigns themed projects but its really like u do whatever you want Really freeing esp when we under such stress  lol 
Ria gives you what you want If you ask her questions she is more than willing to help you out If you want to figure stuff out on your own she doesnt interfere She has a lot to teach and has a good sense of humor She doesnt assign too much homework but what she does assign she expects completed as asked I suggest taking a class with her 
She is really helpful The class is really fun although it is slightly hard to keep on drawing every single day along with the weekly assignments at the beginning of the year 
I took International Environmental Negotiations with her and was THRILLED Professor Gleason is one of the best professors at Tufts and I would highly recommend her 
Amazing professor Very knowledgable funny Great with office hours Pushes you to do better but makes it worth it One of my favorite professors 
Gleason is a hyperbolic treehugging Sheltering Suburban Mom You really cant challenge her narrative and she doesnt understand anything outside her environmental realm even though she desperately tries to make the connection The grading wasnt that hard but the workload was tedious If youre IR Security her class will only frustrate you 
The class has a lot of reading but she goes over most of them in class Shes not a harsh grader and makes lectures interesting 
If you do the readings and attend class youll do great Anne says its up to you whether you read before or after class but I found that at the pace she teaches it helps to read before Shes very understanding and sweet and the whole department is pretty laid back 
Anne is an excellent prof All notes are written on the board before class and are clear and informative If you attend class every day and take consistent notes you can do well in the class Anne is helpful and available outside of class as needed Labs for class are engaging and  of the labs are field trips Overall one of the best profs

Anne is awesome Shes really interesting and shes excited about geology and teaching it to her students So helpful Her class notes and lectures are great and very clear 
The discussions in class ended up being pretty interesting but that was more to do with the people in the class than Prof Gibson She was nice but not always the most helpful when you were trying to understand a grade you got Some of the reading seemed pointless 
great teacher really helpful and understanding easy grader more concerned about your personal development as a writer than your grade 
professor gibson may be the most uninspiring poetry teacher ive ever encountered she assigns poems to read then probes us to discuss them in a rightwrong format and gets frustrated when students dont regurgitate her opinions also shes useless when it comes to your poems take with a different professor to avoid wasting a semester

Every question Rebecca asks has a right and wrong answer This makes class discussions frustrating at best and painful at worst Shes more critical than encouraging of students writing and you can show her the exact same poem and get completely different feedback depending on the week If you really want to write poetrytake the other professor 
TOUGH GRADER 
Dont take a class with Gibson She will cuts you off in class discussions to inject her own opinion which is really just pure fluff and shes only happy if you regurgitate stuff that she likes No clear grading scheme or weighting system and can never justify her grades A very frustrating class  dont waste your time Worst professor ever 
Dore is amazing Im so glad I took photo with her Shes very caring and definitely becomes involved with her students as individuals Theres definitely a big time commitment for any photo class but its worth it Her apparent absentmindedness provides amusement but when it comes down to it she provides really valid feedback 
Dore is the greatest She genuinely cares about her photo students and their progress in the class Everyone in her course ends up becoming friends and the laid back informal structure of classes is very relaxing and unstressful Take her class 
Dore is TOTALLY insane but fantastic Incredibly supportive really knowledgeable but a little wacky Incredibly interesting class I recommend to anyone interested but its a big time and money commitment for the darkroom Incredibly worth it though Dores a hoot

Dore is one of the best professors Ive had at Tufts She is a little nuts at times but it provides some comical moments and she truly cares about her students are their artistic progress She isnt crystal clear all the time but she is always more than willing to help Shes a great person to form a relationship with a real artistic resource

Professor Scheck does a really terrible job explaining key concepts and does not respond well to questions in class She writes out long complicated mechanisms silently only explaining them when she is done and everyone in class is only halfway through copying so it makes minimal sense As a biochem major I really hated this class

Shes an interesting lecturer She has a strong accent but still understandable Her lectures are very helpful in understanding the material Shes got a good sense of humor Even if you end up being bored by the lecture itself youll find little gems here and there The TAs are harsh graders and make the recitations kind of useless

Shes so knowledgeable about the subject because shes from the Ukraine Her accent can be heavy at first but you get used to it Honestly though her stories about her life really add to the class So long as youre willing to read and talk the class will be fantastic 
Prof Shevel might not be the most entertaining lecturer but her classes are very organized and she always presents the new material in a clear way She also gives a lot of helpful examples and makes difficult concepts understandable Overall I really enjoyed PS and learned a lot Take her class if you dont mind a fastpaced teaching style 
Shevel is nice and funny at times but Comparative Politics was torture She would stare at the ceiling and lecture for the entire class ignoring people who had questions And there is pretty much no direction on the  page paper you have to write The midterm wasnt hard but the readings are really boring Dont take this unless you have to 
Lectures are boring cant understand a word she says Tests are fair although multiple choice questions are often random and dont seem to cover anything that was discussedstudied Readings are boring and long and not clarified too much in lecture Recitations are mandatory but helpful and TAs are nice responsive and helpful 
Readings are hard and long She barely goes over them and when she does chooses small unimportant parts of readings Class is horribly boring plus you cant understand a word she says Tests are fair but TAs sometimes grade harshly Recitations are mandatory but often a waste of time although the TAs try really hard

Professor Shevel is fantastic and clearly an expert in Soviet and PostSoviet politics She has relevant and entertaining stories and she is a pleasure to learn from 
Love her class and love her Shevel is a fantastic lecturer and encourages discussion to the point that shell pause midsentence to take questions She punctuates the lessons with her own life experiences in Soviet Ukraine She even brought a former Ukrainian defense minister to talk about RussiaGeorgia Fair exams highly recommended 
Go to lecture That will save you Shevel goes through all you have to know during her lectures I didnt do all the readings and still got an A Lecture can be a little tough to get through It can be boring and her accent and fast talking are a challenge But shes brilliant and youll learn a lot in this class She answers emails at all hours 
Prof Shevel is a really interesting professor who is extremely knowledgeable Her lectures are very thorough and she discusses a great amount of topics She typically speaks nonstop so if you dont enjoy lectures this class isnt for you She speaks VERY quickly and with a Ukrainian accent so be prepared to stay alert if you want to keep up 
Comparative Politics is an interesting class and Shevel is a knowledgeable professor Her lectures are sometimes dry and her instructions arent always clear but shes always willing to help during office hours and answer questions during class One caution she has a fairly strong Ukrainian accent

Professor Shevel is wonderful as a professor and as a person She explained the readings thoroughly made class interesting encouraged class participation and provided helpful comments on writing assignments 
She is one of my favorite professors here 
For someone with vast knowledge and an interesting life story I found her class very forgettable I cant recall anything that stood out in her class outside of a few funny stories about Eastern European politicians Im forgainst her 
Love her Lectures can be a little dry and her accent takes some getting used to She talks fast so I recommend typing your notes just to keep up if youre not a fast writer Readings were a bit too long but recitation helped with understanding them Exams are fair but wish the  paper was a bit more clear Shevel has great Soviet stories 
Oxanas an excellent professor She is from the Ukraine and was an elections monitor there so she has very good personal insights into how postSoviet countries work Lectures were interesting and the readings and workload were good Id highly recommend her 
Gives great power points that are very clear and logical Test follow information presented in power points Takes a subject that can be taught in a confusing way with a bunch of random readings and makes it very clear and logical I took another class with her because I liked this one

Someone please remove her She had to be one of the worst Tufts experiences Ive had 
Both class and professor are totally bizarre but awesome All of the books and discussions are extremely interesting and Stephanie herself is a hell of a character Medium workload tons of fun Its a step outside of your comfort zone 
This was such an awesome class because we got into such cool discussions This dynamic really depends on your classmates but Stephanie is a really great person and exremely positive She really open including to having class somewhere else Great class

Carolyn is great She is really laid back and funny Going to her class is a pleasure She is always happy to answer questions alhtough sometimes we go off on tangents and end up not getting a lot done She knows her stuff She gives a lot of exams and they are kind of annoying but overall a good class that I would definitely recommend

The course was great Not difficult work was reasonable  tests were mainly based on lectures but it helps to read the textbook Each week we participated in a discussion board just a paragraph on the question   replies Tests are straightforward If you get a question wrong she writes a comment explaining the right answer really helps 
Lectures were pretty straightforward Grades consisted of papers You could essentially write the papers about any topic of your choosing which was nice Not a tough grader Reading textbooks was not necessary though I did 
I had a very poor experience with Karyn for Picasso to Pollock The only assignments are two papers a midterm and a final  but all are focused on regurgitating HER opinion Her lectures are horrendously boring and she wasnt nice to students either Expectations are unclear Tufts Art History has better Profs avoid this woman 
Professor Esielonis really knows her stuff She assigns readings but theyre pointless because her lectures cover everything Two papers a midterm and a final The papers are just your opinion so they arent hard and the tests arent too bad Added bonus I took this for an art credit and was one of about  straight guys among  girls 
Program evaluation Never taken something like this before She made it interesting really valued the students input and opinions and was INCREDIBLY helpful and accommodating when I was in a rough spot She is very fair to everyone If I was in her department Id take another class with her again Highly recommend 
I really like the professor but the class was another matter Lots of history in the beginning which was a total bore Material gets moderately interesting as the class progresses but still not very engaging Fair exams typical classwork BBTrunk postings due every class which becomes very tedious Overall good professor mediocre class 
She is by far my least favorite professor at Tufts I do not enjoy her class she rambles and she is boring No powerpoint only her talking She also only wants you to reference books and not your opinion or other classes She is not the best grader and she is a little naive

While Mme Geoghegan is hard shes one of the best French professors Ive had and really expanded my knowledge of French language and grammar Shes the sort of professor you have a lovehate relationship with Id take a class again with her 
Terrible teacher who will embarass students in class Constant mood issues and not very open to differing opinions I agree with the statement that she is obviously on speed Walks like a chicken too 
Professor Geoghegan definitely earns her reputation of being an intense teacher If you dont understand a reading she treats you like youre an idiot Shes sweet so take the time to get to know her in office hours Also she gives away test answers in office hours and will correct your essay for you if you bring it in before class 
Very abrupt and has frequent mood swings Her class made me tense and onedge because she was not very understanding of any difficulties one might have 
I really didnt enjoy this course at all The exams didnt correspond with what was taught in class I wouldnt recommend this course 
Worst professor at tufts period She has no interest in the students success purposefully freaks students out and will single you out if you dont understand a concept She should never have been hired 
The workload if you keep on top of it really isnt that bad learn your grammar  tests wil be fine Geoghegan was really mean and made me horribly nervous at the beginning of the end but by the end she was fine Never great though 
obviously on speed 
Didnt like her at first too spastic and hyper for am But you grow to love her shes not mean With homework EVERY night you cant help but learn Group participation very high 
Prof Geoghegan may seem intimidating at first but she is actually very nice and helpful This class was extremely difficult with a lot of work   hours for each class for me at least While tests are a challenge and grading is tough participation counts for a lot and you can do well in the class 
Class moved very quickly but a lot of information was taught Prof Geoghegan is very enthusiastic and energetic when she teaches and she can be funny in her own eccentric way She is always concerned about the progress of each of her students and I found her to be a nice person and a good and frequently demanding professor 
I really feel like I didnt learn anything in this class I came in a little nervous about it being a bit hard but I was eager to learn nonetheless but my grades have stayed mediocre This is primarily because I dont know what she is asking half the time If you ask for help shes like oh youre doing fine even if youre not Choose someone else 
She is a bad teacher She is not clear in her directions If a student does not know an answer in class she becomes angry and will be mean to the student Also the exams are not organized well and she does not specify what is important to study and what is not She is a horrible teacher 
Prof Geoghegan is definitely love or hate her I personally loved her shes basically a crazy French old lady She speaks quite quickly and can be hard to keep up with If you see you dont like her in the first few days of class maybe you shouldnt stay but if you do shes great She really cares abour people understanding grammar concepts 
Worst french prof at tufts 
She is a bad teacher She is not clear in her directions If a student does not know an answer in class she becomes angry and will be mean to the student Also the exams are not organized well and she does not specify what is important to study and what is not She is a horrible teacher 
This professor will take what might have been a promising language student and destroy them She will utterly demoralize a student into feeling as if anything they do will result in failure She will purposefully single a student out rather than help I am a successful premed sophomore and have never had a class this difficult utterly awful 
She has incredible energy and is genuinely interested in your comprehension and progress The bad ratings probably came from people who did not get a good grade She really appreciates it if you make an effort on your essays and you speak up in class Theres quite a bit of work be warned but her comments on essays and tests are all very helpful 
Prof Geoghegan is incredibly disorganized and not helpful at all The class sessions dont help you learn and the homework is just as useless You are completely on your own when it comes time to study for your tests 
She gets a lot of flak for being intense but shes a fine professor Some kids need an intense environment to learn languages Prepare to do a lot of work but also to read and discuss interesting things I especially learned a lot of grammar well She sticks to the book so make sure you study what she highlights in class but also the chapter 
I personally love prof Geoghegan She is certainly demanding but what legitimate French teacher isnt but her class really isnt too much work if youre decent at French Anyone who thinks she is mean is clearly unable to separate their lack of French skills from the professor whose job it it to grade objectively 
Many people may have problems with Geoghegan and yes she can be a difficult grader but she is a good teacher she can intimidate some but is actually very friendly and wants to help 
RESPECTED 
Natalya is the most lovely caring human I have had the pleasure to interact with at Tufts very knowledgable and so passionate 
LECTURE HEAVY 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
I heard a lot of great things about Natalya but she left my class midway through the semester In the time that she did come to class she wasnt clear about assignments and it was hard to meet with her 
Natalya was a hard working professor who was willing to meet with me but she demands a lot of work and she isnt always very clear about what she wants Her assignments are poorly organized Shes also not always very open to differing opinions 
GET READY TO READ 
SO MANY PAPERS 
This class focuses on the textbook and supplementary readings So if you dont read you wont pass There are  papers and  tests She talks a LOT and sometimes it seems in circles but thats philosophy The only complaint is she takes excessive time to grade prepare to wait weeks 
The class is really as easy or hard as you make it You can get by without doing the majority of the readings because you dont have to participate in class But her notes are really unclear and it seemed like her expectations on essays were unrealistic and certainly not well explained 
Take notes of everything she says Great teacher Very helpful if you go for office hours Youll do well 
She is a great teacher whos really funny Her notes on the board are really useful especially when it explains arguments from readings Her paper topics are interesting and its obvious by her comments that she spends time grading your essay carefully Her jokes in class make up for when the material is dry Its a good introduction to philosophy 
Valentina came late to class then spent the next  to  minutes writing on the board she kind of went through the material and often put students to sleep there was class discussion but only for the students she wanted to hear from and if she didnt like you you couldnt get an A take Philosophy  just not with her 
Professor Urbanek is terrific I came in expecting to enjoy Philosophy and she gave us great readings while going over each text scrupulously in class I loved the massive amounts of feedback she provides on papers This is particularly helpful because you are allowed three rewrites Take her course 
puts students head to head with philosophers if you have any interest in philosophy you will enjoy and learn 
she is absolutely bar none the best language professor i have ever had she is extremely helpful and always makes the classes interesting when you dont think it would be possible DEFINITELY TAKE A CLASS WITH NANCY IF YOU GET A CHANCE 
Nancy is the best spanish teacher Ive ever had Shes extremely lively entertaining sweet and helpful I learned a lot without working too hard And she definitely cares for each student

Shes professional and intelligent so sweet and lively and lovely cares about her students  
She treated her students as if they were her own children I looked forward to going to her classes 
I felt awkward asking questions if she thinks its a stupid question she gets frustrated and sarcastic making it very uncomfortable Im not the strongest Spanish student and she would get impatient with me easily She knows her stuff but I hated going to class 
RESPECTED

TOUGH GRADER 
Ive had conflicting feelings about her since my first day of class Shes my only teacher at Tufts who can leave the room while her students are working and the students remain silent and studious All of her students have a lot of respect for her however she can sometimes be too harsh Tough grader but very passionate 
Nancy LevyKonesky is an amazing Spanish teacher Shes really enthusiastic and loves her students  even gives chocolates during exams Shes adorable and great at explaining things She really fosters class participation and makes even the apathetic students want to get involved I would absolutely take another class with her

She is one of my favorite teachers Ive at at Tufts so far She is incredibly enthusiastic and funny and makes class go by fast She is a pretty easy grader on compositions and tests and such a nice person Definitely suggest taking a class with her 
After the first test I was scared that LK will be a hard grader but everything turned out ok She is very enthusiastic and her classes are usually pretty interesting She incorporates her own handouts and videos into the course Most importantly she gives out candychocolate on test days

She is a tough grader and takes her job more seriously than some of the other Spanish Department Professors She also seems to play favorites a bit with students She also likes to call on students randomly If you do the work you will be fine

Professor LevyKonesky is a solid Spanish teacher Spn is a mix of grammar review and discussioncomprehension of some Spanish literature both of which she teaches well Grades are from participation  quizzes  tests  TVshow reviews and  compositions If you put in effort  act on feedback you will do well Definitely recommend 
she is probably one of the best language teachers i have had she not too tough when it comes to grading compositions and exams which makes me like her even more def recommend taking a class with her 
She is a fantastic teacher who truly wants her students to succeed She may seem a little stern on her exterior but she is very friendly and approachable Every so often she randomly brings Puerto Rican snacks or candy to class She is an easy grader but her assignments still require some hard work  nothing extreme

Eh 
Shes a bit scatterbrained but overall a good professor Shes not that harsh when it comes to grading and attempts to let students pursue their interests However she tended to cover material a bit shallowly leaving me underprepared for upper levels

Professor Kanarek is a caring and knowledgeable person who does not have or no longer has a flair for lecturing She recites material blandly out of the textbook and does not maintain an inclusive classroom She gave us a project once to pretend we were poor and had to use food stamps and to write down how it felt Also very hard to email 
She is an understanding and caring teacher One of the best Ive had at Tufts She is brilliant Take any class you can with her 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
SO MANY PAPERS 
TOUGH GRADER 
I have never had an English teacher that I dislike as much as Prof Brown If you want a good grade in English do NOT take her class she rarely gives As Also her feedback on papers is so critical that its hurtful made many students cry Long story short she is critical of writing without ever teaching how to write I do not recommend 
Soooo tough Tough grader tough class Im a little queasy from right now but learning a lot I guess 
Tough grader but generally helpful with assignments and gives great feedback Grades work very VERY slowly and usually you will not even know how youre performing till the week before finals which means it will be too late to drop the class already Material is interesting but very poorly organized and discussed 
i thought she was pretty good she uses actual economic journal papers which is cool 
Professor Hardman has an alphabet soup of degrees and is clearly passionate about what she teaches However her classes are lecturebased which makes it hard to be engaged Secondly shes a terribly slow grader She assigns many projects but youll be lucky if the first is graded by the end of the semester

one of the best instructors ive had in psych clear lectures and shes very helpful always recommend perception to my friends cool course 
Professor Ditman is super helpful and truly cares about the students and puts a lot of time into helping us out She gave us a killer study guide before the final exam which helped a lot I wish I could get my ORGO prof to do the same Always available on email to answer questions Highly recommended Prof 
I was worried that this class would be too hard or boring but professor Ditman is really great at making the students feel confident and comfortable with the material She works hard to make sure we all understand is very fair with her response paper grading and is always available via email or otherwise Overall I recommend this class 
Professor Ditman is great She seems genuinely interested in the topic and lecture is rarely boring Quizzes and tests are easy and shes a generous grader on papers The syllabus makes it seem like there will be a heavy work load  quizzes  papers  exams but very little outside studying is needed I definitely recommend this course 
This professor is probably not exactly an expert in perception  I looked her up and she does neuroscience stuff But where she lacks in knowledge she makes up for in genuine sympathy for our understanding and progress and engagement with us Shes super supportive Lectures can get boring but then again its perception Book is boring too 
The lectures were unbearably boring but the class itself was super easy I got by with minimal effort The class is definitely worth taking for an easy A Shes also super nice which is a plus

Professor Ditman is one of the worst professors Ive had at Tufts Shes a nice lady but really does not know how to teach She throws definitions upon definitions at you which makes the class almost unbearable This class has the potential to be very interesting but unfortunately it fails hard 
I took freshman year english with Mareike For some reason the class was composed entirely of engineers but by the end of the semester we had all grown to love both Mareike and English The readings were thought provoking the assignments were fun to write and Mareikes feedback was always helpful and constructive I highly recommend this prof 
MAREIKE IS THE BEST TAKE ENGLISH  WITH HER The readings and discussions were interesting and the assignments were so much fun to write about She is a really great professor who will give you so much individual attention if you go to her office hours She is awesome Made me love writing Could not say more good things

Randomness in lectures lack of direction in analyzing readings frequently dull eccentric TAs to spice it up a little complete lack of grading plus an absurd final exam Shakespeare is great to read but this prof didnt do it well 
One of the best profs Ive ever had Always open to unexpected ideas in class but also always has her eye on managing the time and gently steering the conversation in productive directions Excellent in smaller settings Perspectives on American Poetry and her Women in Fiction courses were both great Occasional difficultchallenging readings 
Very concerned with our viewpoints intelligent and an excellent prof 
Random boring very strange teaching style 
Her lectures consist of telling the kids to say what they thought about a story and then commenting maybe She doesnt put grades on papers and forces students to do peer teaching for  classes total laziness She is generally unenthused 
Horribly dull professor who ran discussions with no direction whatsoever A ridiculous grading system rendered class pointless Relied on TAs to interact with students Dont ruin Shakespeare by having her as a teacher 
No she wasnt She was cool 
Shes a little absent minded and crazy but shes a lot of fun She has great insights and is good at motivating an interesting discussion 
instead of letting the class discover things for ourselves she constantly said let me tell you what i think i found that annoying

Class was all discussionbased Shes a little absentminded and has a quirky sense of humor but often throws out little nuggets of amazing analysis She can spend a long time talking about a very short poem so be prepared for that Good feedback on my papers I looked forward to this class every week 
Probably one of my favorite classes at Tufts so far Shes well versed and intelligent  the class runs off of discussion so its really important to do all the reading and be as insightful as possible Its challenging but students are able to surmount it 
perspectives on american poetry was amazing the readings and discussions are very interesting and bamber always has insightful comments very laid back awesome 
Class was Buddhism its influences on Modern American Poets Course material was very interesting although she probably gave me a better grade than I deserved 
Prof Bamber is a great professor meet with her when you dont know what to write a paper on she is extremely helpful 
Do not take Perspectives in American Poetry as a freshman even if you placed out of the English requirement It is esoteric The course material is interesting and Bamber albeit exceedingly quirky and in her own little world is a good teacher Grading is a mystery Not too much work 
Bamber is very flaky and only cares about her own opinions I would not take another class with her She is difficult to get a hold of outside of class and is just not a good professor overall 
MARION IS A GODDESS 
She really cares for her students and goes the extra mile

Chill teacher just copy her notes no need to actually listen in class 
This was Professor Gees first time teaching the course and I thought she did a great job with it I only rarely used the textbook if you pay attention to class and keep track of the handouts you should do fine Behavioral economics is a fairly new and evolving field as well so its an interesting class to take 
Prof Gee is probably the best economics professor at Tufts I highly recommend taking any classes with her Her teaching style is really clear and you know what to expect on the exams She is also very clear about where she expects the median of the class to be so you can gauge your performance relative to the class Strongly recommend this prof

Im a very confused by the past reviews To put it frank Laura Gee is not a good teacher Her class is the most dreadfully boring one I have ever taken at Tufts her notes are rather disorganized and her teaching style is really poor Expect to take simple notes ping ponging from subject to subject and then an exam she has not prepared u for 
Take notes in class and do the problem sets diligently and youre guaranteed a good grade 
The class was a really interesting crossover between psychology and economics and definitely presented a different perspective than other econ classes at Tufts Professor Gee was very enthusiastic receptive and extremely clear in her presentation of the material 
Great teacher Very clear Exams can be hard but its mostly from notes you take in class so its fine 
Mme Trichard is an excellent professor She tries to get each student engaged and is really helpful and nice The class is based on discussion of each days reading two papers and two tests 
great teacher really enjoyed class 
Trichard is my favorite French professor at Tufts Shes really nice caring and understanding and she really tries to get to know every student in her class The workload is steady but not overwhelming and she will usually grant extensions if your reason is legitimate Shes also a pretty fair grader Highly recommend her  classes 
If you show up do the reading and remain reasonably engaged shell be nice to you If you sit in the back of the room and try to melt into the wall shell pick on you a bit Fair grader and a nice lady Seemed to lose her patience with some class members who werent as strong in oral expression Good class fair prof 
Great Teacher makes class lots of fun

Feng Laoshi is very understanding and clear She is a wonderful instructor and inspired me to seek a minor in the Chinese department 
Feng Laoshi is probably the best Chinese  professor Tufts has got She is very understanding with attendance and extensions She is always available outside of class and gets everybody to participate in class She teaches at a great pace and really cares about her students 
For people with no background of Chinese this might be challenging but regardless Feng Laoshi is one of the nicer professors Tufts has to offer Shes very lenient if you cant pass in homework ie wont take off points for late work and is very understand and gets everyone to participate in class 
Great Teacher very helpful and caring She is extremely patient and understanding if you were able to hand in the homework on time Her tests are fair and she grades them fairly One of my favorite teachers at Tufts definitely 
I cant say enough about Feng Laoshi She is absolutely fantastic so kind and forgiving on tests and homework understanding of confusion but unwilling to let you stay confused Shell cold call you in class and it will make you nervous until you realize how unbelievably much youre improving You cant go wrong

Bishara really makes sure that the theories that we learn connect to the lives that we live and the environment that we live in We are asked to connect theories to stories about our interactions with the state and the community that she creates in the class is really wonderful I also love that we start every class reviewing last weeks readings 
Professor Bishara is absolutely wonderful Her seminar is a perfect balance between her explanations and class discussions Shes very helpful both in and outside of class and explains assignments clearly The readings are fascinating and reasonable in amount She is very passionate and knowledgable Also shes super nice Take her classes 
I agree with the previous review Great professor  extremely nice downtoearth fair intelligent and passionate Be warned theres A LOT of reading Sometimes a book a week and it can be very hard to get through One of the hardest classes Ive taken because the material is so dense 
She was a great professor who was extremely clear in what she wanted Class was boring at times and there are lengthy powerpoints however the info is pretty interesting There are two takehomes that help you really well I almost never did the readings and ended up with a really good grade in the class Should definitely take this class

Professor Bishara really cares about her students and the content of the class She wants everyone to succeed There was a ton of reading in the class It mostly correlated with the powerpoints There were only two major assignments the whole year a mid term paper and a final paper They were both take home I would definitely recommend 
Just amazing Jenn is a great person to learn from She clearly has a unique PASSION for patterns of psychological development 
She is a terrible teacher very strict and paranoid She is a very nice person in class but extremely passive aggressive when it comes to quizzes and testing The other psych  professors are much easier than she is so dont take it with her if you can avoid it 
She is young energetic and tries to come up with ways to make stats fun She is really dorky and cute she looks like Anne Hathaway The quizzes were hard but its easy to make up your grade I failed all the quizzes but ended the course with an A Most people do well in the class You have to go to lecture but you dont need the textbook 
Bad teacher 
worst teacher ever so annoying and just not fun to take a class with tests were unnecessarily hard 
She is young and energetic and funny Stats is not the most exciting subject but she was entertaining Quizzes and exams are hard but fair You really need to go to lecture Lots of chances for extra credit almost everyone in the class got an A or B 
Statistics as a subject isnt very fun but Professor Dicorcia definitely made this class fun when I took AP stats it wasnt fun at all Since I came into this class with a background in Stats it was rather easy for me Didnt really need the textbook she made all the resources available online 
Really great teacherfull of excitement every dayvery clear on what you need to know for testsquizzes and prepares you well If you participate and show effort youll be fine 
shes great native speaker has great teaching skills and command of the class uses class time very efficiently isnt an easy grader but ive yet to find a spanish teacher at tufts who is taker her class also shes very nice and adorable 
Marta is a very organized and helpful professor She is a total sweetheart and wants to help you I took the heritage class and it was time consuming but if you try youll get a good grade 
In order to do well in this class just show effort above all Thats actually a factor in calculating the grade she WANTS to give people good grades Do all the assignments even the stupid little ones The exams are kind of hard she wants to know every little detail of the stories Time consuming class but easy material for some from heritage

MG is a professor that will know your name even if you dont make an effort to connect with her She can be brisk and will call you out for not paying attention or knowing whats going on but she truly cares about teaching her students and works hard to make sure everyone knows whats going on She also is very accessible in and outside of class 
Awesome professor taught tough material very clearly Also scores points because she is a sports fan although she had some sort of internal conflict between the Red Sox and Yankees Overall a great professor and a decent class 
I admit I didnt frequent this class frequently but when I did she was a great teacher 
very interesting very cool teacher moves quickly yet clearly through material as stated in a different entry quirky sense of humor makes class much more interesting glaser is very enthusiastic in teaching or at least calc very random really great teacher

Mary Glaser is the best math teacher I have ever had She made what was already fairly simple and easy to understand even simpler and easier

Professor Glaser is one of the good ones She seems to be a little overhyped but she is definitely a great educator Spending time in the classroom I really got the sense that she cared about and understood the experience of each one of her students 
BEST PROFESSOR EVER Shes amazing makes all concepts extremely clear and is always entertaining in class I would take every class she teaches if I could 
TOUGH GRADER 
Shes very sweet but her lectures are unclear and she doesnt explain concepts very well Test questions are confusing and have double and triple negatives which can be quite frustrating to deal with 
TOUGH GRADER 
Quiet speaker very confusing lectures Goes on seemingly unimportant tangents or uses strange examples that are then made the focus of her examinations She told us that calculations are the central part of her exams but they barely made up  Memorize everything in order to regurgitate it on tests no matter how seemingly random and unrelated 
TOUGH GRADER 
Ambiguous wording asks you to draw conclusions on topics or terms she mentioned only in name not in function in maybe one lecture Only way to succeed find tests from previous years and study them religiously 
Professor Chew struck me as a nice lady She clearly knows a lot about population biology and explained most of the concepts very well She also held a lot of office hours and review sessions so if you have a question make use of them I will warn that her exam questions are difficult because she likes choose the false answer 
TOUGH GRADER 
Her tests have the most ambiguous wording possible allowing for at least  or  arguably possible answers and at one point a triple negative Across the board low scores on her tests

Dr Souvaine is a respected professor at Tufts and nationally She is thoughtful and very intelligent Solid lecturer who loves her chalkboard Sometimes she needs to be interrupted or she will lose you and the whole class The highlight of the course was the intentionality of the homework and exams combined with her willingness to help students 
TEST HEAVY 
Prof Souvanine has good intentions to teach but she is just horrible at it She always uses the old professors slides and sometimes it feels like its her first time ever seeing them in class She goes over material super fast then pretend like everyone got what she was talking about until somebody tells her to slow down because they are lost 
shes one of the est teachers Ive ever had The class is extremely hard though 
Algorithmsthe Devil Prof wonderfuldevils advocate 
If you are mathoriented you will love her otherwise you will get lost Her tests are very long so write at least something intelligent for each question Shes a good professor and will care about your progress but watch out for the sometimesunnecessarily complicated math explanations

I have to second the previous comment Spot on w everything Also her pettiness is shocking She singles out  berates students publicly for any little thing that bothers her The homeworks are like riddles which absolutely REQUIRE a TA to provide addtl info to solve The mean exam scores are abysmal Thank god for Aloupis recorded lectures 
One of the best 
This was a poorly run class I relied on the previous professors lectures The two head TAs were grumpy uninterested and the recitation sessions run by the TA were useless went over just basics and he had inadequate English skills I regret taking the course this semester 
GET READY TO READ 
By far the worst professor Ive had at Tufts She seemed to have no intention to even attempt to be a good teacher with incoherent and unprepared lectures unclear exams and grading Her role on the National Science Foundation was clearly the only thing she wanted to do with her career and a generation of Comp  students suffered for it 
Viola Thomas is a very sweet helpful woman I did not learn much of anything new in her class but it was a good chance to practice my French and read a few good books She is always willing to meet with students outside of class There is not much structure so she is willing to let students discuss random topics during class Not too much work 
One of the weakest french teachers I have had barely spoke french in a  class and also emphasized the grammar while barely grazing over the literature or converstation aspect of the class The essay subjects were lame and had little bearing on the cour 
One of the nicest profs very easy going recommended 
The worst French class that I have ever taken Asks yesno questions  not discussion questions Rarely discussed the texts read Instead questions focus on plot We spent a LOT of time on grammar which was totally useless and watching pointless short videos Shes not a native French speaker and spoke English during class Not a  level class 
I thought Professor Thomas was not only very nice but helpful and easy to understand as well I found this class relatively easy even though my french background was rather shaky I recommend taking French classes with her 
Very sweet and understanding professor Class had a very loose structure so she was always up for random discussions about the news or french culture Very easy going about assignments barely ever collects them Overall a fairly good class 
I completely agree with the person from  they totally hit the nail on the head By far the worst french class i have ever taken Given the poorness of her teaching she grades remarkably hard which is absolutely ridiculous 
She doesnt get to design the syllabus so you cant really fault her for that but she doesnt exactly make it fun Kind of a nondescript styleshe covers the material decently sometimes gives feedback sometimes not sometimes forgets to send promised emails and always manages to go over time when you have a class on the other side of campus 
Viola is a very kind professor Sometimes the work is a little boring but overall she makes class an enjoyable experience She provides helpful feedback and consistently easygrading A very good choice if you want to learn French with low pressure 
Shes gross I went to office hours and she literally clipped her nails in front of me straight onto the floor She can mumble and is therefore difficult to understand Disorganized and it was hard sometimes to know what was due when But understanding if you forgot something Not that hard 
Solid professor I think my French improved Can be a bit boring and theres sometimes tedious homework

Madame Thomas could do a little more explaining for assignments and classes are quite boring Not terrible but not fun

Viola pretty much teaches using only the exercises in the textbook making the class fairly dull Focus is almost entirely on grammar If you are torn between taking Fr or Fr if you have that option go right to Fr She is fairly lenient with assignments and you will do well if you do all the work and study hard and do the extra credit 
Very good professor Although much of the class was review for me it really solidified the concepts we went over The tests were fair and justly evaluated The work was not excessive for a language class 
I took her Disney course It changed the way I look at all films and literature I wish I had found her before my last year and skipped all the other Tufts English Dept courses where the professors dont want students to learn to think critically at all As of  Sarah King is still teaching this course in Summer School Its awesome 
Great teacher I love her classes The readings are always interesting and she is a very fair grader 
A great course by a great prof who actually teaches critical thinking close reading and all those other skills were supposed to learn but no one else bothers to teach 
I had her  years ago and I still remember the class One of my best profs ever 
I had her for Toni Morrison I dont recommend taking a class solely about one author to begin with The dullness and repetition of Morrisons texts combined with Prof Kings rather snide attitude toward the vast majority of the population was a bad mix 
Amazing class with a prof who really teaches and values critical thinking and is engaged with her subject Not a course for students who dont care about literature and film

Dr Alzahabi is a great lecture and wonderful person I took PSY Perception and PSY Cognitive Control with her She is so kind and I learned a lot from her lectures The classes I took were easy and straightforward and very interesting topics She is very clear about her expectations and a fair grader Definitely take a class with her 
Amazing professor Very articulate and will be sure to answer all questions you have during class and after Friendly and warm atmosphere Love the small class feel 
Easily one of the best professors in the department and at Tufts She explains everything so that everyone is able to understand and makes the subject actually interesting She really cares about her students and puts a lot of effort into the class Workload is fair but definitely manageable 
Professor Batchelder is an incredibly nice teacher Although Chemistry  was a very difficult course She tries to do her best to help and she really does Unfortunately without a knack for Chemistry her tests and problem sets will be extremely difficult I would recommend her to anyone but not in this course 
She got handed chem  at the last minute and man did she do a good job Shes so willing to help and understands that when the whole class does poorly that it is not entirely their fault 
Very difficult class but she cares about her students very much and scales a lot because she wants us to learn instead of worry about grades Very willing to help friendly kinda adorable haha Easy to contact for helpquestions or just to chat Goes very fast in class but just ask her to reexplain after class and read the book for more help 
Batchelder is very nice and sweet Shes good at explaining concepts but sometimes she took a while to recover if you pointed out something that didnt make sense The class was a bit excessively difficult though It felt at times as if Batchelder wanted us to fail but ultimately she curved our grade to a B not a B so that made it better 
Dr Batchelder is amazing Very clear very nice and incredibly understanding and likeable Office hours are great Chem  is one of the hardest labs I have ever taken however she doesnt give you quite all the information you need so a lot is left up to you Took  hours a week for a half credit 
She is AMAZING She is the sweetest professor in the world She tries so hard to teach an incredibly difficult topic Dont be scared if youre lost in the beginning  it all gets a lot better once youre over the first couple of sections Definitely take a class with her  Quizzes  Take Homes a midterm and a final hw every once in a while 
She is amazing Very clear encourages questions and is very concerned that everyone understands everything Listens to students well I highly recommend her 
Great teacher and great help Lab reports and lab combined too  hours a week for a  credit course Lot of work 
Wonderful instructor Her presentations were always clear she is very approachable and very nice I cant wait to take another class with her 
Batchelder teaches PChem Lab and honestly shes one of my favorite professors on campus Shes SO sweet helpful and human Her quiz grading was very lenient and she was always eager to help students understand the material The labs are a lot of work timewise but thats to be expected and is just the nature of a lab course Great professor

TOUGH GRADER 
Really tough grader and gives horribly vague feedback on essays doesnt even mark up the essay simply leaves a comment at the end after giving the grade Definitely would not recommend her Her lectures are also boring and I dont feel like Ive learned anything Ive been a great writer in high school but shes such a harsh grader 
TOUGH GRADER 
She is an extremely tough grader Expect to recieve a whole letter grade less for each essay compared to other ENG classes Her teaching is dry and uninspiring She offers very little feedback on assignments and does not give clear grading criteria 
Mrs Meister really brought the subject matter alive She is passionate about her field and clearly very knowledgeable If you seek her out she will go above and beyond to help you In my experience she was a very sweet woman and an excellent professor I definitely recommend taking a class with her 
I took a summer course with herIt is amazing how well prepared she is for lecture Her enthusiasm for class material will convert you to like the material no matter your initial indifference She has a quirky sense of humor probably explained by generational differences maybe cultural for some jokes i laughed hard other not 
She refuses to put her slides up on artifact which makes studying for the exam VERY difficult She also has a difficult time answering questions or straying even slightly away from her lecture The courseload is very light though two exams and one  page paper the TA is useless 
This class could not have been more boring She takes about an hour to say what could be said in  minutes and its not worth the effort anyway dont take this class 
Maureen Meister is one of the best professors Ive ever had She is utterly enthusiastic about the subject and just as knowledgeable Her lectures are so interesting that even a  hour class goes by really fast She is always friendly kind and helpful She will make you want to do your best work take her class Youll not regret it 
Maureen is extremely intelligent and well spoken in architecture and Early American art history She handles student questions with thorough answers and tactful insight I have never had a teacher so well versed in a subject incredibly helpful enthusiastic and engaging invests in each student on individual level 
Professor Meister is a great professor I truly enjoyed her class Additionally she is extremely knowledgeable about the subject I definitely recommend taking this class 
Not a bad class overall I didnt do well on the midterm  but managed to still pull a B for the year because of the research paper and final all calculated as a third of the grade TA review sessions are a huge waste of time 
pretty clear teacher lectures do get boring but she shows a lot of enthuasiasm for the subject she is also very willing to compromise eg extending due dates for papers or late assignments etc 
Professor Meister was great lectures were engaging and the material fascinating If you seek out her help she will spend time and energy helping you to succeed in her class 
Prof Hoffman is one of the best profs Ive had a Tufts She is very warmwelcoming writing discussion based class helped me learn the material much better This was not a class you could slack off in because we had forum postings on trunk twice a week but the workload was more than fair This was by far my favorite class of the semester

Each week you write a response to the reading online Then in class she comes prepared with comments about everyones response and asks people to expand on their ideas So you have to be in class you have to do the readings and you have to be engaged That said the class is fascinating I wanted to read and discuss Take this class 
Hoffman is very nice but is possibly the worst public speaker I have ever seen which is problematic for a lecture class I took a tally of the amount of umuhs she had in one class and got  which doesnt count the stuttering and repetitions There are many different lecturers for the class though some are quite good 
Interesting Class 
She is clear knows her stuff and gets her point across very well 
the class itself was really great id recommend it there were lots of guest lectures i actually only went to lecture for the first monthrecitation is all you really need and do the reading but the material is so interesting midterm and final were tough papers not bad must study thoug

Laney is great Comp is a big class with a really wide variation of skill levels some people know a bunch of programming languages some people have never coded before I had no programming experience but the level of instruction is so good that Im now considering CS for a second major Lectures are informative and fun Take this class 
This is the easiest csds course I have taken yet I had the worst experience Multiple assignments were graded unfairly and I get perfect scores when the TAs are grading them I suggest you to try the best to avoid her 
Professor Strange is at best a terrible professor She grossly oversimplifies the material taught to the point of spouting misinformation Students end up learning nothing and taking away little from the class She is also extremely passive agressive On a positive note all classes taught by her are extremely easy 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Prof Strange explain Python in a way that you can only understand that if you have basis of the program The lecture she does in class are completely messy and doing her homework was always a struggle She gives examples in class that are totally unrelated with what she put in her homework

Dont graduate from Tufts without taking a class with Professor Eyl You do mock theological debates take field trips to museums play history of Christianity bingo and think about religion in totally new and complicated ways Now Im kind of obsessed with how much religion overlaps with economics politics ethnicity and systems of power 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
This class seemed to have no plan She assigned work as she saw fit and a lot of class time was wasted doing repetitive tasks and talking Actually acted very little Did one big monologue and one scene with a partner and that was it Weekly email hw that is very annoying She advertised a lot for other classes and assigned lots of small random hw 
One of the most amazing professors Ive had She made the ancient texts we read come to life unearthing new meanings I am not a fan of political science yet I found her inspiring and all her lecturesdiscussions fascinating She goes out of her way to get to know every student and encourage them to participate Even her essay prompts engaged me

Very intelligent class atmosphere feels like more of a discussion than a lecture and interjects funny stories to keep your attention

Vickie Sullivan is a fantastic and engaging lecturer She brings the rather difficult texts alive in class and engages with every individual as if their contributions are as meaningful as scholars of platonic texts She looks for the best in everybody and takes each student so seriously her passion and enthusiasm is infectious Best prof ever 
Professor Sullivan is a great lecturer who really knows her stuff I really dont care for the classics but I enjoyed going to her class Work load consists of a midterm and final exam  pages each I believe 
Professor Sullivan is the best teacher at Tufts University 
Incredibly passionate teacher and every lecture was a pleasure because she mixed her own insightful thoughts on the readings with constructive class discussion She is a leading classics scholar and that is clearly demonstrated through her articulate and thought provoking lectures I would recommend this class and professor to all students at Tufts 
She is an extremely passionate lecturer and despite the class being relatively large for a course directed primarily at close textual analysis she encourages class participation and discussion Shes a jovial presence in the classroom and the content is engaging if youre into ancient philosophy 
WPT I with Professor Sullivan was one of the best classes Ive taken at Tufts Her lectures are extremely thoughtful and make the readings understandable even if you didnt read them thoroughly before class As long as you pay attention to lectures papers are not too difficult Highly recommend this class and her as a professor I learned so much 
I agree that she is the best teacher at Tufts She has groupies that is how great she is

Vickie is an incredible professor Her lectures are inspirtational and exciting She promotes an engaging and explorative classroom atmosphere She is the type of professor who really teaches you how to think I could recommend her enough 
Sullivan definitely brings a lot to the table in terms of her lectures which are engaging and though provoking That said youre dealing with Plato Aristotle and Machiavelli and then some and their texts are dense and hard to dissect a lot of the time 
Vickie Sullivan is am AMAZING professor She is incredibly charasmatic and engaging and really does manage to bring life as cliche as it sounds to the driest of material She is a fantastic lecturer while at the same time encouraging discussion amongst students By far my favorite professor TAKE HER CLASSES

Professor Sullivan is great at what she does and teaches a good class That being said I have little interest in classical philosophy which made the already dense reading even worse and lectures were difficult for me to pay attention to Sullivan is a great professor however Just dont take this class unless you love classical philosophy

The BEST spanish teacher at Tufts She is wonderful She makes learning a language a delight Shes a great teacher and a wonderful person She genuinely cares about her students and goes out of her way to make sure they succeed I took spanish  with her and switched out of my spanish  class with another prof to take it with her AMAZING 
Profesora Haltom is awesome She really works hard not only to get to know every student but also to make sure that everyone understands and comprehends the language as well as what is expected in every assignment I had her for both Spanish  and  and would have chosen her for  if she taught it

Professor Haltom is great The class isnt too difficult but it requires a lot of busy work Keep up with the textbook and the online exercises to do well

Took Spanish  with Pam All but  classes are mandatory and there are lots of assignments but no in class quizzes Good at teaching Average Spanish speakers bot A and B not A 
enthusiastic extremely nice made the class very easy by going over everything on the tests held our hands a little too much  classes got repetetive she spends most of the time explaining somewhat open to alternate views 
Honestly one of the friendliest and most helpful teachers Ive had Super willing to help her students if they are struggling and gives plenty of extra credit Just make sure to get to class on time 
She is a sweet lady who presents the material fairly clearly She is very energized and sometimes moves too quickly to really listen to students questions Overall however very reasonable and very understanding The syllabus is straightforward as are the tests I would recommend her to anyone 
Professor Haltom is a super nice professor and the class is not terribly difficult Shes not very strict with homework and the tests are very manageable Im taking her class again for Spanish  because I liked her so much 
great at explaining and using a simple and clear spanish nice too 
ughnot the most vivid of teachers but real nice lady 
She is seriously the nicest most understanding teacher Ive had at Tufts She only makes you follow the syllabus while other spanish teachers apply work on top of that HIGHLY recommended

I took American s Art and Culture with Professor Johnson She is extremely knowledgeable has a great sense of humor and makes discussions very interesting I would gladly take another class with her She is a hard essay grader though 
very biased toward her own views seems unclear about the material she teaches frequent and completely irrelevant tangents intimidating very unhelpful comments on papers 
Prof Johnson is awesome I took PoMo Lit and loved coming to class every week Although the lecture was large Ronna made it feel like a book club constantly seeking input from students and fostering a conversation that was always upbeat and interesting Besides her teaching ability Ronna is an eccentric funny woman who keeps class lively 
great professor  not open to conservatism at all but i mean hey who the  is these days and who the  should be if you participate in class and DEFEND your arguments she WILL favor you I definitely enjoyed the class and the professor 
Professor Johnson was very thought provoking Yes she is liberal but its not in a vacuum What shes teaching about womens rights tend to be mostly a liberally backed issue I took her On the Road course which had great books and great conversation Meet with her before doing a paper because she can help you get to the point faster 
She is a wonderful passionate teacher 
Im very surprised by the other comments on hereProfessor Johnson is AMAZING She is knowledgeable passionate and inspiring This is the best course Ive taken at Tufts The class discussions are great and she strongly encourages participation 
interesting class though the prof is a bit eccentric readings are fairly interesting prepare to read a book a week only one paper and the midterm was pretty straightforward overall a pretty laidback interesting class with a character of a prof

Johnson is a nice person but a mediocre professor The lectures only focus on her own interpretation of a novel which doesnt let students to analyze on their own Her prompts are also VERY vague and she doesnt give you the grading criteria Instead of helping you writegiving feedback on drafts she sends you to ARC which is unhelpful 
She is absolutely the worst professor and and a person at Tufts I have to give it to her for having so much passion for feminism but she is very biased and irrational She reads into everything too much and she is closed from alternate views not to mention very critical of them She is oddly harsh about extensions and is VERY rude about it 
Favors students only accepts  is partial to HER point of view 
Do not take a class with Johnson if you hold more conservative views As a liberal I found her tangents about the incest in the Bush family hilarious but I could see how that would get really annoying if I didnt agree with her She is a really thoughprovoking and passionate professor

Prof Johnson is an outstanding English professor She is approachable hilarious and incredibly intelligent She has an immense amount of passion for what she teaches and that rubs off While some may find her class disorganized she is very easy to follow if you read the books and participateattend class AmFic  was great 
She is constantly going on tagents about her political views instead of teaching We dont really learn how to write well and she is disorganized and a hard grader 
I have no idea where these negative comments are coming from Ronna is without a doubt my favorite professor at Tufts She has a fantastically sarcastic sense of humor which makes class fun She puts a lot of thought into course material  debunks it very well Her writing standards are fairly high but I became a better writer Takes liberal POV 
passionate about what she teaches 
BEST PROFESSOR EVER I took both of her American Fiction courses Shes spunky but extremely intelligent Her classes are enjoyable and she isnt a tough grader if you take her class seriously and make an effort to speak out during discussions 
LOVED her class very approachable kind of eccentric but definitely a person worth knowing 
Loved her 
I was never interested in Womens Studies but after taking her class and reading the articles I found WS very interesting Im even considering majoring in the subject Ronna does go off on tangents a lot but they are interesting and they are related to the discussion She makes this intro class very interesting

Definitely need to go to class for the notes but dont necessarily need to read the books Her ideas are novel and shes open to discussing new interpretations of the text I could listen to her wax poetic for hours Totally understands what its like to be a student so her stuffs not overwhelming Generally  essays midterm and a final 
favors some students and pretty much ignores everyone else the class is supposed to be about postmodernism but she does a terrible job of explaining the movement just says vague things with esoteric jargon never proved to me she understands it herself 
Ronna is a great English professor We go through books quickly but the discussions are often thorough and involve lots of student participation Shes funny and cool but I could imagine that more sensitive students might find her a little abrasive Great if youre not afraid to here some strong views but shes always tolerant of opposition

I cant say enough good things about Professor Johnson I have learned so much from her about how to read write and think She is opinionated incredibly intelligent and super funny I loved the course selection and recommend her to anyone who wants to take a seminar Im taking another class with her next semester and I cant wait 
Excellent books for each of which she has a single central point which is pretty easy to grasp You can do well in her class by regurgitating her ideas Because of her unilateral readings class was dull except when she decided to rip into some poor student who had the gall to say something Also very rude in email which was weird and unexpected 
Ronna is not a bad professor The books that we read in this class are generally excellent and she does a good job at explaining them She is strange and extremely liberal but I didnt feel that she wasnt approachable I found the class a little frustrating because there were so few grades but the structure of the class was consistent 
ugh 
Beat Lit was AMAZING with Ronna The woman knew these writers hung out with them and really understands the whole culture and essence of beat If you have any interest I strongly recommend as shes both highly knowledgeable and insightful on the subject Not to be missed 
Shes interesting to listen to has good insights chooses good novels But i felt the class was unfocused There were a few odd concepts she held onto but I dont feel I really got a thorough understanding of the period and when it came to the final I felt pretty underprepared Plus she hated when people asked her questions about it 
Thing is her liberal bias isnt so much fun or interesting as it is obnoxious and stupid So even if youre a devoted lefty youd be better off rereading Zinn or something instead of sitting through her crap And crap it is terrible reading selection uninteresting lectures of the quotyou werent there manquot variety unfair grader 
Research is her prioritynot teaching 
soo bad 
Youll work pretty hard to pass her class 
Learned a lot 
This class is really hard 
She is decent 
Wowpretty tough class but she tries hard to teach us 
Take genetics with Siegel Freudenreich appears to have little concern for student progress and is much more focused on her own research than on teaching 
Prof Freudenreich is a brilliant scientist and wanted us all to start thinking like a researcher The class was engaging and handson Although it may seem like you failed when she gives you feedback she is a very lenient grader and just wants you to succeed and think critically about your work Most of your grade is a final paper 
Preferable to Siegel Fairly straightforward although her tests are very difficult She gets flustered if you ask her questions and cant always respond correctly 
She will help you a lot if you just go and ask it is really challenging but she is nice and friendly 
Would not recommend this professor or course Lectures are her reading off of paper as if shes reading off of a printed Wikipedia page No visuals and stands behind the desk  of the time Lack of knowledge and homogenizes Africa Not clear on the subject matter and extremely biased Felt bad for those that took this as their first anthro class 
I think she is good She seems a little nervous but she obviously understands the material and doesnt just teach out of the book She does make mistakes on the board but not more than other teachers Ive had And she definitely makes an effort to help students by sending out materials via email 
Never take a class of hers She makes lots of mistakes during lectures and cant fix them while students are watching her Asking her a question usually results in more confusion I can tell she is smart but she just is not good at teaching 
I am sorry to say that DrByun is one of the most useless professors that I have ever encountered She teaches false material that is obviously wrong but insists that she is right Then when it comes to the exam the material she said was right she marks as wrong This woman should never teach another class ever again Save yourself alot of trouble

Cant deny that shes passionate The work is straightforward but not easy There is a TON of reading it will keep you busy all semester You can get away with not reading it all though The tests arent hard if you prepare for them but they take an enormous amount of preparation and you need to have taken good notes all semester long

I echo all the great comments on here She is extremely endearing knows her material through and through and wants only the best for her students Shes the kind of professor who will make you want to work for her If you show up to learn you will be immensely rewarded with knowledge of things you didnt even know you knew nothing about 
She knows a lot about her subject and really cares about what she teaches you The tests were fairly simple if you go to class pick  out of  identifications date place and significance and you could prepeare your own essay and question beforehand 
Professor Penvenne is a fantastic professor and an even more fantastic person She knows what shes talking about and cares about all her students success Lecture style can sometimes be slightly haphazard but she is extremely helpful in clarifying if you ask Overall she is one of my favorite professors by far 
Her lectures tend to be all over the place and her powerpoints are not helpful review material you really have to commit yourself to doing the textbooktype readings berger and cooper in order to understand whats going on the other readings were less relevant and you can definitely get away with not doing at least half of them 
Very disorganized and hard to understand lots of reading Penvenne clearly knows a lot and is passionate but that doesnt translate to her teaching well Tests arent terrible if you do the reading and prepare 
As a second semester senior and a transfer student thats studied abroad Ive had quite a few different professors None hold a candle to what Penvenne is capable of She is not only  dedicated to her students but she challenges their way of thinking in ways that impact their entire lives 
I took Reconstr Africas Past to  and I highly recommend it Its a lot of work Dr Penvenne does an excellent job bringing forth key issues in the production of history The subject matter will probably make you think twice about your conception of history as a process I enjoyed filling in the blanks on an underappreciated continent 
CARING 
HILARIOUS 
I thoroughly enjoyed Eng with Professor MacDonald She is a hoot and spends the class period zipping around the classroom in her wheelchair Yes her grading takes a while and the assignments and due dates are usually quite unclear but this is totally not her intention and never affects the grades negatively Turn something in Easy A 
Great teacher She assigns alot of work but if you keep up you wont have any problems She makes herself available for help and is easily reached 
She is a really nice person but her class is not very challenging or thoughtinducing its high school all over again but this time prof macdonald is like a mothering hen that holds your hand 
She is very unclear about her assignments expectations etc She is a tough teacher but with that when she does think you are doing a good job it means a lot I was so frustrated while taking this course but in the end it was worth it An abstract summary of readings which are difficult to understand are due each week but no exams 
She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had She is unclear grades come as a shock and does not explain herself Grades often went down AFTER a revision is submitted If you can avoid her do so 
Good teacher Easy class 
She is a very easy teacher as long as you do the reading and do the work The material she chose was very interesting and we discussed and wrote about what we read in depth covering somewhat superficially economics philosophy science and more We read Marx Darwin Jefferson and more 
She has a nasty habit of snapping at individual students who dont understand any part of the reading Her comments are usually not very severe which makes the grades come as a bit of a shock ie decent job C Well done B The readings are not long but students are assigned a lot of writing some form of review or abstract is due every class 
Yes Professor MacDonald is a nice woman who will help you However she is flakey with meetings and the help you get is useless This class was a waste of time and money She is extremely unclear and makes class torture to sit through 
She pretty much makes me wish not to take a writing course ever again Her assignments are unclear her grades come as a shock and shes not very forgiving to students who are unable to stay on top of the class even if its for legitimate sickness or family problems 
A nice person but not a great teacher She is not very organized returns assignments absurdly late and is not clear in her assignments often reworking the prompt after she has given it I love English but dreaded coming to this class 
Fall  She was dedicated to get her students to write better She did a great job helping me write well and she did it very effectively There was very minimal reading but the reading was difficult There was a good amount of writing but the assignments were no longer than  words Just essays no tests Participation counts towards grade 
Shes very confusing in class and makes students come out of class with more questions than they had when they went in 
Easy class if you do the reading which is easy cares about student progress Not for the student who wishes to be challenged good for the writing impared and engineers like myself 
tough criticism often crosses the line from constructive to just harsh tends to misinterpret your writing and give you low grades gets irritated lots of revisions at the end of the semester was the sweetest saying we were all great writers i think i learned some things from her but she often made me feel incompetent in the process 
She makes you think outside the box with crazy prompts but I loved her class She can be a bit confusing but just dont be afraid to ask 
Professor MacDonald is extremely unclear about her expectations for the work she sets which is worst part about the class She assigns many short papers that pile up in addition to the main assignments Shes a great caring and nice person but creates unbalanced workload If you take this class always clarify what she expects for your work 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Professor MacDonald is an interesting woman She is passionate about what she teaches and only wants you to do well in her class However she is very unclear with assignments bad with returning work and setting up conferences with her is a task in itself Despite all of this the workload is not bad but you will definitely be confused a lot 
really concerns with students understanding in class and welfare of students in general 
Prof MacDonalds English  class was great Shes a real character and she helps guide good discussions The only annoying thing is that she assigns alot of small papersand sometimes they pile up 
Easy class if you do the reading and participate in class Writing assignments are short and graded pretty easily 
Professor MacDonald is a very sweet woman However she is as confusing as she is confused In English  I didnt know what was do when And when I figured it out and handed in work I would not get that work back The class was easy because I could get away with not doing work But it was just a waste of time because she didnt teach anything 
Mrs Macdonald is challenging but if you get past that she is all help and will extend herself no end and wants the best for you but you have to work 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Professor MacDonald is a difficult teacher to take a course from She is not clear at all what she wants done for class In class she will go on tangents and no one knows what is going on If you go in for help she will help you but you get more confused Prompts are not clear I would never take another class with this professor  
Shes a very nice and laid back lady She will help you and despite what others say she will clarify anything so long as you ask If you give her a reason as to why you did something your way she will be understanding and wont always take points away Shes an interesting person to say the least 
Although she is very nice Prof MacDonald is not a good teacher She is very confusing and her essay prompts are absurd I did not enjoy going to class at all 
Hard class interesting material Professor Kelly is a good teacher but doesnt seem all that interested in her students 
meh 
Professor Kelly is brilliant Her lectures are clear and easy to follow she makes sure to repeat concepts and encourage discussion The readings are interesting and relevant to the course and the writing workshop she heads helps exponentially Very pleased with course 
She speaks clearly and she accepts different opinions 
hot as hell 
An extremely dry and dispassionate lecturer I was so interested in the material and she almost killed it for me Maybe she is smart but she doesnt convey that through her lectures 
Excellent class really changed the way I think about law and society Three papers but the last two especially were actually enjoyable to write Class is mostly discussion based and like all phil classes the topics can get very confusing and murky but Kelly is good at picking up on what people are trying to say and clarifying it for the class 
this class was more than just a watercolor course she is very well versed in painting and everything else that comes along with it  lovely woman concerned with improvement doesnt discriminate based on talent very fair 
Kate is great So sweet really eager to get to know students and see them improve I am an artist and still got something out of the class and I know the nonartists liked it too She has really interesting stories and is flexible with attendance and projects We also got to go to her studio and a show in Boston on a field trip

INSPIRATIONAL 
Only good things to say about Kate She is always so open minded to peoples individual styles and when she gives critique it is always very justified and actually helps you improve She teaches you some foundation techniques and honestly they really help your skills I learnt so much about my own style and felt it develop as the class went on 
Professor Finnegan is incredibly sweet and tries to get to know her students I had no experience in watercolors and am now at least competent That said three hours is a long time to sit on a stool and paint Professor Finnegan has preferences for certain aesthetics and techniques so that can be frustrating but generally she is very helpful 
Talks about nothing but feminism might be interesting if thats wut ur into but she just rants and raves about it in a noncoherentlogical way 
Completely completely uninterested in anything the students have to say that does not subscribe to her personal agenda Not very good at connecting the dots and oftentimes appears to support her opinions with no more than guesswork Not confident enough to elicit real discussion or response from students in seminarsdiscussion 
TOUGH GRADER 
INSPIRATIONAL

Shes really good professor shes clearly very interested in the subject and excited about the development of polymers in different fields Shes very helpful in office hours and understanding to students problems However she gives really hard homework problems and tough exams 
She really wants you to succeed 
She has so much enthusiasm for the class and is able to make difficult or boring readings fun and meaningful At times the class felt like a jump from Spanish  because the vocabulary can be challenging but it is manageable The workload  readings for every class  paper  pgs   pgs and  exams

Prof MarquezRaffetto is an outstanding lecturer Easily the best professor Ive had at Tufts I cant speak highly enough of her A true gem In addition to being caring funny passionate and truly knowledgeable she is a fantastic mentor 
This was an awful class The professor just lectures the whole time completely inappropriate for a highlevel literature course I will never take another class with her again 
I had Profesora Raffetto just once and loved her so much She is incredibly enthusiastic loves discussion and is interested in her students contributions Sometimes she can talk a little too much and class activities can be the same small group discussions but her love of the material really shines She adds humor and energy to the classroom 
Hard stuff made fun best prof in department 
Even though the content of the course sucked she still made the class interesting 
Tamara is passionate about Span Lit and it shows She has a rare gift for making even the most mundane readings fascinating Shes a little picky when it comes to papers but once you get the first one back youll adapt to her grading style She expects a lot but summarizes difficult rdings in class and is always available if you need extra help

MarquezRaffetto is simply an amazing professor She is so invested in her material and comes to class every single day with a smile The class is so straightforward and easy to do well in if you pay attention read SHES SO NICE 
This woman is an absolute gem She is enthusiastic and even in one of my darkest semesters made me laugh every class The reading is manageable but at times difficult to adjust to the more antiquated styles She does have high expectations for writing assignments however she is so specific and direct in refocusing your work

She is an amazing and engaging lecturer  I thought Medieval Spanish lit was going to be the most boring class ever but she made it interesting and accessible Very sweet and cares about her students a lot Lots of participation but she made it easy 
She is my favorite professor here She knows so much and her lectures are enthusiastic Its not easy but it is worth your investment 
The class was a senior seminar and great for an easy A She gave the impression of ditziness and a lot of times couldnt answer our questions though she was very friendly We had a fair amount of work but do it and youll get an A 
This class necessitated an incredible amount of writing for an intro course over  pages The readings were often engaging but the lectures were often not so The legislative simulation however was a lot of fun and was a great learning experience Overall a good class and worth taking

Ive taken two classes with her Shes my advisor and I love her 
Horrible power points with little guiding structure Could not answer basic questions Inordinate focus on polling because that is her specialty I felt that was most of the class Interesting final projectwe had to write our own congressional legislation Quite frankly she just doesnt seem too smart 
I took two classes with Prof Masuoka One was a boring course requirement The other was a seminar on immigration that legit changed and enhanced my perspective on the subject She is best when in small group dialogs and really cares about her students 
Masuoka was nice but easily side tracked We were constantly behind the syllabus and had to rush at the end Grading guidelines were unclear 
super nice professor who is very understanding Interesting discussions during class  the  hour seminar doesnt even feel long im taking a class with her again this semester

She is very kind and very intelligent She is a bit scatterbrained and seemed to have a hard time organizing the class and the assignments She has been excellent in office hours and extremely helpful but she is kind of disorganized in class It was a lot of work but if you do it you can easily do well Big research paper at the end 
Worst class ever Very boring unclear Many have stopped going to lectures and doing the reading

Professor Masuoka is a very good professor She is clear and always posts her powerpoint slides to trunk Though she is not a super tough grader there is a decent amount of outside reading you should do for a good grade lectures alone wont cut it 
The papers that were the basis for the majority of our grade had little to nothing to do with the legitimate discussions of American politics that you would expect in Intro to Am Politics It was not clear how they were going to be graded Lecture material was really basic and the readings were not necessary for the papers or the quizzes 
The premise of the class was exciting an entire course built around a mock congress However in application much was lost Lectures were thoroughly uninspiring and did not explicitly relate to the mock congress Masuoka was helpful at office hours and she was friendly but overall I was pretty disappointed 
Very boring incomprehensible and redundant Syllabus had to be altered  timesand we still only made it through October Professor doesnt seem to care about the class Great idea with Exit Poll project turned into drawnout waste of time Exams are graded inconsistently and its impossible to know how to improve your results

SO MANY PAPERS 
I had taken AP Gov in high school so PS was kind of a breeze The tests could not have been more straightforward and the short answers were very much expected There were two writing assignments the guidelines for which were incredibly clear and thus the grading was fair as well I didnt participate in discussion section at all but didfine 
Poli research methods w Masuoka is a great class for poli sci majors It fulfills the methodology requirement and a math distribution requirement Its also really not that hard Its way easier than AP Stats and even people w no background in stats should pick it up quickly Very little reading but  projects that require a lot of writing 
I had her for Intro to American Politics she was not very intelligent in my opinion She seemed chained to the slides and failed to answer any questions 
Professor Masuoka isnt the strongest lecturer and the course material for this class was somewhat dry She did however come up with debates and interesting assignments that forced you to engage with the material This class also taught useful methodology skills as promised Class time is boring but she really does care about students 
Shes very ditzy She fumbles around questions and reads straight off her slides adding no additional information The slides are useless and really dont capitulate the readings There are a lot of papers The only upside of this class is the mock congressional debate at the end 
Professor Smith had interesting anecdotes to information and was helpful in clarifying when students had questions She also had great communication skills with students  she was easy to reach and asked students what they diddid not like about the class often and altered it when needed She was a bit frazzled at first though 
a great prof who knows her stuff  if ever overwhelmed in class stop listening to all sound for one minute and just stare at habers body expressions  its quite amusing 
Please disregard all positive reviews of this woman Shes nice but incredibly insane more insane than anyone Ive ever seen Discussions about the greatest writer ever quickly descended into a fog of chaos and confusion God speed if youre in this clas 
She really knows her stuff though she can be pretty intimidating If you get past that though you see shes quite nice and really wants you to do well 
I was extremely disappointed by this class Haber is intense but her lectures were uninteresting Seemed to miss the point on why we still read Shakespeare If you think the only reason to study Shakespeare is to search for phallic symbols and talk about sexuality then this is the class for you 
An awesome professor with lots of passion  if youre not interested in the topic her ethusiasm and talent are wasted on yougo get cliff notes or something my only gripe is if sitting next to her in a SMALL classroom watch out for those flying elbows 
shes weird a little nutsenthusiastic but still doesnt lift the class from being boring as hell 
Tons of reading lectures boring as hell PHEW 
If you demand oversimplified ideas dont take this but if youre ready to be challenged and interested youre in for a treat Shes great

Would recommend English and nonEnglish majors to take one class with her She is nice wellspoken funny and gives interesting lectures If you do the readings Which are not difficult and give good effort for essays you will do well Enjoyed my time in her class as a budding English major 
decent class with dull material but haber is aloof stomping around the room and making ridiculous claims about imbedded pseudosexual inferences only wants to hear her own ideas repeated 
Wonderfully manic and incredibly intelligent Her Shakespeare class was based far more on discussions than lectures but she was always ready to lead the class if it faltered rather than expecting the students to carry the class I adored her class

I very much appreciate her enthusiasm  she makes Renaissance lit very comprehensible On the other hand shes made me cry twice She singled me out in class as not having done an assignment even though I did and if youre not an avid participant you can tell she doesnt think highly of you A soso teacher overall 
Very intense inyourface lecturing Has interesting ideas and lectures very keen on keeping discussion going LOTS of reading so dont take this class unless youre really into English 
Enthusiastic intelligent really fun 
I am guessing the comment below arose from a misunderstanding She is one of the nicest professors Ive ever hadalways eager to help students will spend HOURS talking in her office with you really Plus shes really smart and interesting Love her 
Shes dedicated and extremely intelligent Initially she comes off as very intense Over time you will discover that her passion comes from a deeply rooted understanding of the material She will occasionally call people out but she cares about her students and her class is fun at the end of the day Plus the reading is really interesting

I wasnt sure about renaissance lit but Professor Haber made it comprehensible She gives detailed feedback on essays and gets excited during lectures She doesnt just talk she asks students what they think and most of the time shes receptive to new ideas If you come to class take notes and show an interest she wants you to succeed 
Professor Haber is extremely nice very hyper which makes Shakespeare go by faster than it can with a boring professor 
Prof Haber is always full of energy and very enthusiasticplus she is personable there are only a few papers and the reading assignments are generally not bad the material is not always the best but she makes most of it at least bearable the final sucks but its not as bad as it could be 
This is a very difficult reading intesive class The readings are not for the faint of heart That being said she definitely succeeds at leading fascinating discussions about very dense course material much denser than any Shakespeare She encourages and often requires active participation and always tries to keep everyones comments in mind

LOVEDDD Cathy and this class Such a cool combo of anthropologyscience topics regarding our American food systems We have  big projects and  exam Readings due for each class to help facilitate the discussions Lowstress but she grades harder than youd think 
The word mediocrity comes to mind She is a great person and an interesting conversationalist but as a professor mediocre 
I did not enjoy this course much The lectures and readings are boring and dont really relate to the assignments though youre expected to reference them in the papers 
shes a really boring teacher all of her classes this semester were  lecture and we sometimes watch clips of movies but thats pretty rare the reading for class is extremely boring so i rely on taking notes during lecture instead of actually finishing the readings

Lots of reading and transcriptions are just annoying But we got to travel to Boston Public Market and she is so kind flexible and understanding She wants everyone to do well and truly listens Very intelligent too 
This was a seminar class Cathy is engaging good at conducting conversation and had lots of interesting concepts discussed in class We even watched The Yes Men However outside of the class reading material was a total bore 
Global Cities is great if you love citiesurbanism  anthro yes both but probably a little wonky if you dont Stanton is an extremely nice person and a reasonably effective professor and the grading is really not that hard Only complaint is that occasionally the subject matter veered away from anthro into overly leftist political discussion

First Anthro class taken at Tufts really enjoyed it good intro provides nice general landscape of the field especially through the lens of Global Cities which I think is very relateable to most students Reading load generally acceptable sometimes a little bit more than Id like but overall decent Super nice and rather helpful teacher 
Great instructor in class but very unhelpful outside of class and can be very unprofessional when it comes to her relationship with her favorite TA causing problems for other students in the class 
Definitely knows what shes talking about Had her for her first semester of comp after her being in industry and it was a very hard class she made the exams so they would take her an hour so they were almost impossible for people in the class however i probably learned the most from her than from any other professor at tufts 
Good teacher for some subjects not all Very obvious strengthsweaknesses Take her for cryptology and higher level stuff Avoid her for basic programming 
Prof Cowen is a good professor in my opinion I discrete math is not the most comprehensive subject in the world but in my opinion she did a good job at teaching it She was available during office hours and by appointment when I needed her to further explain something to me I think she was great and know she knows her stuff 
Shes definitely not the best lecturer around for not using class time wisely And she jumps among topics a lot and leaves out some Fortunately the grading is fair exams are quite easy and straight forward She also drops the lowest score from the three exams so thats great 
Professor Cowen is reasonably good at teaching Discrete Math although her handwriting is incredibly difficult to read A problem set per week takes about  hours to finish Exams are fair and usually much easier than the homework 
Prof is not at all helpful The test questions look nothing like the homework The homework is intense and the lecture notes are not very helpful It was necessary to utilize numerous other books to complete the homework Take any other class taught by another professor she is the worst professor I have ever had 
Only covers  of the material in class leaving out the harder topics which end up in homeworks and exams anyways Youre basically on your own and youll spend countless hours trying to decipher things which really should have been covered in class Shes also INCREDIBLY rude Take COMP with Blumer instead he cant possibly be any worse 
Made a class that I thought would be extremely entertaining very boring 
Shes a nice lady but she does not use class time to its full advantage and she leaves a lot of material out Ex HW due Monday covers material on that HW the Monday its due in class Very frustrating Good grading policy though TAs marks on HW are useless Cowen needs to provide solutions 
In a discipline that is all about clarity Professor Cowen is not as clear as she could be The homework is also excessively difficult 
Shes pretty decent Discrete Math is nobodys favorite class but the grading is fair and she was nice enough 
Hated this class Ostrander rambles on and on and I think she could cover a lot more information and engage students if she were more organized and actually had a plan for each class She is very opinionated and tries to cover it up with being PC but it doesnt work She assigns reading but never really follows it Class is easy but sucks 
Grading is very strange plays definite favorites 
Ostrander loves the sound of her own voice There were so many times when many people in the class wanted to speak but were never able to because she talked for too long The takehome exams are a plus Her grading sometimes seems to make no sense though 
Sex  Gender is a great class Prof O led very interesting discussions and the workload wasnt bad at all Only problem was her arbitrary grading and little help provided in office hours Overall a fascinating class 
Doesnt care what u think even if u support it with facts 
Susan Ostrander is the most confusing lecturer She is as boring as rocks and does not help students with comprehension if they seek extra help 
I feel like shes too outdated and not in touch with our generation enough Learned a lot though even though the class was incredibly easy as long as you did the reading and went to class all takehome exams is a major plus 
The course was very interesting She would ask for participation yet be nasty about your answer if she did not like it She is trying to be nice I believe deep deep deep down inside I would recommend the course 
Professor Ostrander can be incredibly rude when students attempt to participate and share their views She often cuts people off and only accepts specific answers she believes are correct even though the subject matter is very objective She is also a terrible lecturer I highly suggest you do not take a class with her 
Half the time I had no idea what she was talking about even though I did the readings and attended class regularly Rambles on and on without making a coherent point Though she is genuinely interested in what she is teaching and she is available outside class so is too opinionated and does not different opinions 
Ostrander was a decent professor She can be somewhat morally righteous and unorganized at times but she is a fair grader and clearly cares about the subject Shes good to talk to oneonone but is sometimes hard to get in touch with She can be kind of down on kids with different opinions than hers but does a pretty good job w urging discussion 
I have no idea who people like Ostrander have jobs Another professor stuck in the s teaching classes you could get for free at a community organization Nice lady but I gained nothing from her class 
Very interesting class material Professor is unclear in class Does not accept alternate views Not a good class 
she only wants to create little carbon copies of herself 
class was often boring and Prof spent too much time defending her thoughts rather than speaking them very helpful in office hours and likes when students take advantage of that 
She is a clear and passionate professor but sometimes she tries way too hard to be PC and I felt it interfered with the honesty of the class How much you get out of her class absolutely depends on how much you put into it Shes kind of annoying with grading 
Incredibly boring prof although it can be fun to pay close attention to her sentences and see exactly how long they are 
Has favorites Lacks excitement Expects you to write and think like a sociologist already even though it is an introlevel class so she doesnt bother to teach you herself Dont ask questions because she will say that she has to time to do such but then she will spend  minutes droning on with her opinion 
A mixed blessing She had very profound ideas and interesting material to read Take home exams rocked The reading was a little strange and she needed to be a little more open to others ideas Still very thought provoking 
If you dont agree with her ideas it will be rough 
She is a very nice woman but classes are boring mostly due to boring material She goes over readings thoroughly but almost too much so you dont have to actually think Overall decent teacher but not exceptional 
Very sweet lady and very helpful if you go to see her regarding assignments or classwork Readings can be challenging  usually because of vocabulary but they are well gone over in class Tests need good amount of studying but very manageable 
I have taken  classes with her She is the sweetest woman ever and truly cares about students understanding She is my advisor and genuinely wants to help me She gives a LOT of handouts in her classes but they are helpful for exams Shes a fair grader too

This woman is not a good professor in any sense of the word At first the class is rather interesting good readings and what not But then the real Stepp comes out Shes unorganized but shell go on and on about how organized she is You really wont learn anything here besides from the cases Going to class was truly grueling and uninspiring 
She is not a good teacher at all The ELS  class itself is very interesting and teaches quite a bit about self awareness how to handle interpersonal relationships through self assessment and assignments But she did not do a good job teaching the material which could have been so good She is also full of herself and thinks she is phenomenal

I took Professors Leadership course and at the beginning was very excited there were personality tests that would help you learn about yourself By the end the idea of coming to class was grueling She claims to have vast amounts of experience yet doesnt realize how bad of a teacher she is DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS Sometimes its time to retire

Mediocre professor Her lectures are incredibly boring and uninteresting Shes not very ambitious and thus not inspiring She absolutely WONT push you to go above and beyond Shes also incredibly strict and unwelcoming when it comes to checking out material at the FMS thereby limiting your ambitions all the more Would avoid her at all costs

literally love her so much shes like the best prof ive ever had 
Very sweet and passionate teacher Best when class is small She wrote the textbook so obviously she knows what she is talking about I really feel like my Italian is improving 
Very nice teacher If you do the homework and participate shell love you The tests arent very hard Just pay attention in class Helpful outside of class if you need help on compositions 
not a fun class and she takes her guidelines too seriously i suggest u avoid the class cuz its def not dance think flailing arms about and making a willow tree 
I was so excited to take her class at first Her writing assignments are ridiculous and she takes confusion personally She gave nearly all the class low marks even though it was supposed to be an easy A Shes also a little crazy people change majors and minors rather than deal with her Take Dr  youll enjoy understand and do well in it 
she is crazy She takes herself and her rules way to seriously I would take this class half credit so you can enjoy it without falling victim to her insanity 
Her physical theater class was fun 
Sometimes takes her rules too seriously The class is fun but dealing with her is not 
Alice is superfriendly Her Intro to Physical Theater class is fun and very little work Also she gets involved with the class and isnt afraid to look foolish Great professor great class I highly recommend it 
Dance Mvmnt  Creative ProcessHalfCredit Prof Trexler is passionate and deeply cares about the success of her students I gained insight into the world of dance from this class However her writing and class instructions are very confusing I wasted a lot of time on papers just trying to figure out what she expected But  shes full of spunk

Likely the best professor at Tufts Hated Spanish so much now I only kinda like it but going to her class made it bearable She is amazing Unreal So fun If you have the chance to take it with her do it Gives out pretty good grades too I got a better grade in spanish  than either  or  She is awesome 
Raysa is one of the best teachers Ive had at Tufts Totally approachable excited about teaching understanding and I even learned something in her class

Profesora was such a great teacher She made it fun to learn about the cultural part to SPN She starts every class by playing spanish music its cute V lenient and gracious grader I did better in this class than in SPN Ask her about her father and shell talk for literally the whole period Its a v interesting story  recommend take 
Raysa is AMAZING She is fun spunky energetic and ohso lenient for those of us who have never taken Spanish before 
Raysa cared about her students and was more engaging than any Spanish professor Ive had at Tufts Although she doesnt devote much time to grammar etc she creates a comfotable environment in which you actually learn how to TALK which is so much more important than learning vocabulary or conjugations in a book Take Spanish with her if you can 
AMAZING LECTURES 
HILARIOUS 
The best teacher Ive ever had hands down You should take Spanish just so you have an opportunity to take a class with her She isnt a hard grader is always willing to work with you and figure things out Most importantly there was never a dull lecture She was always full of energy and it was infectious she got even the shiest kids involved 
Raysa is the BEST so approachable she really cares about her students if you ever have a question about class or need some advice shes there for all her students great enthusiasm too 
Absolutely amazing professor She makes class fun I had her in a late class and she made class something that i looked forward to and actually wanted attend She cares a lot about her students encourages conversation and allows for projects to be fun and not limited I would definitely recommend her 
I love Senora Mederos She was energetic clear and caring She was always understanding of students and willing to slow down or speed up according to the classs needs She was very flexible with due dates Im actually sad that I probably wont get to take another Spanish class with her she was great

I can see how Prof Mahoney might seem like a smart passionate teacher of classics but she is without a doubt my least favorite teacher that I have ever had in the history of my career as a student before and during college She was the most unforgiving grader I have ever done work for STAY AWAY FROM ANY CLASS SHE TEACHES YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF 
Classics of Rome  There is a lot of reading for this course about  pages a week She is much better than any other professor who teaches this course right now even though she is more difficult If you are a Classics major you NEED to take a class with her because she is so passionate and knowledgeable even if she is intimidating

SO MANY PAPERS 
Professor Mahoney is a linguist and not an English professor Thus her assignments often deal with the Greek language and other formal features of the texts This is good for classics majors or linguistsnot everyone She is highly intelligent and she knows everything Her comments on papers are savage At least you know that you dont know 
Intermediate Latin with Mahoney has been my worst experience at Tufts She assigned an overwhelming amount of work and would not curve the quizzes she gave us although the class average was often a  or  failing grades I spent between  hours on homework each day and my entire section struggled through this class Not worth it 
Very knowledgable but not in complete touch with students Will do well if go to office hours

Worked my butt off for a B Very frustrating the whole time she is not very direct in telling you what she wants in an essay When you send her a rough draft she sometimes tells you to start over instead of helping you fix the one you wrote Even if you get an A she will only comment on the negative parts of your essay doesnt sugarcoat at all 
The material really pulled me through the class as an english major it was tough because she talked a lot about translation Had an argument with her about citations and I dont think I ever recovered from it Class should probably be a classics majors only course 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Prof Mahoney is passionate about Classics and definitely assigns interesting texts but if you have an interest for Classical literature simply dont take this class She is tediously filological She often asked us to find how many times a name appeared in the text rather than focusing on the story the background and the style of the work 
As a senior looking back on the courses Ive taken at Tufts I made the best decision taking this class as a freshman In my four years here I have met few professors as engaging and dedicated Shes challenging and possibly a bit crazy but Mahoney is one fantastic professor and person Push yourself and go for it 
She is one of the most eccentric professors I know but definitely one of the smartest and nicest She loves the material and knows it and everything else backwards and forwards She also knows how to teach that different people learn differently A Lot of Work In spirit she is a cat 
At times frustrating bc she is so much smarter than anyone and doesnt realize it but she is more than willing to give you the time you need to do will She is VERY FAIR

Very passionate about Classics and clearly knows her stuff but thats sort of where the problem lies She claimed this class was an introductory course but it clearly favored those who knew Classical Roman literature She assigns a lot of reading and expects you to recall details That being said shes a pretty great adviser 
Her enthusiasm for the material is unparalleled Once you get used to her braid shes a great professor but if youre looking for an easy class dont take hers You will WORK 
I had been waiting to take Katies class for a while because she has quite the reputation among the poetryliterary community at Tufts for being both brilliant and extraordinarily helpful not to mention her poetry kicks ass shes written three books I cant express how much both my understanding of the form and my own work improved bc of her 
Spending time with her was the most important experience I had in college Shes off to California now so California kids get in on the know this is easily one of the greatest scholars of poetry one of its greatest teachers and one of its most amazing practitioners in the country today so BE THERE 
Katie Peterson was the best professor I had at tufts She is a brilliant speaker and poet but beyond that she is an incredible teacher She taught technique and other poets wonderfully but what was most striking was her ability to inspire students By the end of my time at tufts I was surrounded by peers who were crazy about poetryKatie did that 
Easily the best teacher Ive ever had at any school Cares about poetry deeply and is fierce about it in the best way She knows when to back off and when to get involved in the discussion Katie will change the way you think 
I LOVE KATIE PETERSON Katie was the best thing about Tufts University What a magnificent person  professor I learned more about poetryhow to write life than any class Ive had before TAKE CLASS WITH HER IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING 
In September I joined Katies class on a whim when second semester rolled around I found myself eagerly taking it for the second time in a row and I was far from the only one Katie is one of the smartest and most caring people Ive met in a while and this class is easily one of the most worthwhile Ive taken in college 
Very poor professor Minimal learning in class Descales the grades in a very small class where students are bound to help each other Very bias Not consistent with grading Very subjective grader Unfair Beware of taking any classes with her She should get fired but Tufts doesnt care lab or lecture is a waste of time No one will like her

Soares rocks shes really nice and really cool loves to help and have students understands teaches both Brazilian and European Portuguese class is structured but a lot of fun  listen to music plays games etc hwassignments very minimal and easy fair grader tests are good 
One of the best people at Tufts Cris is really into teaching Portuguese and will work with you to improve your grammar and speaking The Portuguese in the Community class is truly a great opportunity to use the language in the community and help others Cris is a saint and will do anything to hope you enjoy her class 
Cris is the best She makes sure that everyone truly enjoys learning portuguese and really engages her students If you need help shes very accommodating Her tests arent easy but arent that hard either as long as you study I definitely recommend her 
Cris is a fantastic professor shes passionate about Portuguese and it shows during every single class She makes class fun cares tremendously about her students and takes the time to make sure every individual student is making progress Exams are challenging but fair 
Professor Jack is an extremely engaging and helpful professor She is clearly very interested in what she is teaching as well as making sure her students understand the content Participation in discussion and attendance are very important Without a doubt the best economics professor Ive had at Tufts A breath of fresh air

Forceful and demanding in class during office hours she is extremely approachable If you cant make office hours shell find a way to meet with you Her expectations are high but if you put in work which granted is difficult shell work hard to ensure your understanding Though she can be a little intense sometimes shes really very nice 
Easily the best language instructor I have ever had The workload is a little draining at times but worth it If you have the choice take a class with her you wont regret it One of Tufts best professors by miles

It doesnt get much better than Rana 
I have to disagree to the last persons post I was in the class when the incident happened and the student was completely at fault The student is lying and trying to discourage you all since he is doing poorly in his class Rana is undoubtedly one of the best teachers I ever had in my life and I will continue to take her as long as possible 
Interesting class but she was all over the place which got frustrating at times 
she is really passionate about the class and a wonderful professor she really cares about her students 
Professor Bernstein is fantastic Her energy and excitement for the subject is contagiousespecially great with Western composers and Beethoven

Ive never seen a college professor get such basic concepts of the course they are teaching so wrong and then so adamantly refuse to be corrected by confused students Weekly problem sets provide a decent challenge but the lecture material is uselessly basic by comparison and again is riddled with errors I wanted to like her but its rough 
Lectures were very clear and she cares very much about her students However I did find the exam questions to be on occasion a bit ambiguous Overall a great professor otherwise 
Professor Lynch wasnt terrible but her tests focused far too much on tiny details she had only mentioned once in class  in other words its easy to get a B in this class but to get an A I would recommend recording her lectures and writing down everything she says Her tests are absolutely based off of her lectures 
TOUGH GRADER 
RESPECTED 
Great professor Learned lots tests were moderately difficult 
Lynch falls somewhere in between decent and mediocre She knows her stuff but I did not find her lectures particularly engaging and she didnt always explain things very well bio  is okay worth taking if you are planning to do something involving biology and want to avoid bio  but I wouldnt go out of your way to take it 
RESPECTED 
TOUGH GRADER 
I would definitely take Dr Lynch again Her teaching style is great and I felt I got a lot out of the course Her willingness to help me one on one with some tough problem sets really gave me the confidence to to make it through the course Professor Lynch is great 
This class was a major disappointment Her tests were incredibly detailed  to the point where they required you to memorize useless information She went way to fast in lecture and often did not explain thing well Ultimately if you want to do well in this course you have to memorize every word of the text book  
Prof Lynch is a great bio lecturer Shes very clear and her lectures are always interesting and she tries to incorporate current research in the field 
She couldnt have made the material and her notes any clearer I got an A and all I had to do was show up to every class and take good notes and look over the notes every once in a while Exams werent easy but fair

she focuses too much on the details pay CLOSE attention in class and take good notes and basically memorize the text book 
Professor Lynch while not being the most exciting teacher ever gives relatively clear lectures She will attempt to answer any questions you throw at her although lectures go at a rapid pace due to the large amount of material she needs to cover Be prepared to memorize a lot of materical that most people would find boring

Christiane is about  or ish years old and is from Austria She does know a lot about German film but as people have said she can be a bit dry but she certainly does know what shes talking about SHE IS A VERY EASY GRADER on papers If you take German Film if you try at all you should do well

Ok as a teacher but dull and tedious Classes seemed so long and had old fashioned perspectives which are just out of sync with the times Shes nice but really needs to retire

Romero is extremely knowledgable of the culture but lectures are quite boring and she gives busy work reading and summary assignments Sweet lady but class was often a struggle to get through and she always ended class late She grades papers based on word choice not really content Only  six page papers and a final which wasnt too bad

Enthusiastic fun teacher You will have to do work if you are not experienced in writing Asian characters but I wasnt and I put in some effort and got an A 
I was nervous about taking a class with Kagawasensei because of everything I had heard about her and my brief previous interactions with her She was very helpful and very good at teaching Japanese I really learned a lot in her class While she was a tough grader as long as you did the work and kept up you would do well 
Shes a really great professor Be careful thoughshe doesnt tend to remind you about assignments or quizzes and there sure are a lot of them so check your syllabus every day Also she shouldve told us in class that there was a short Kanji section on the final Still her comments are helpful and shes fairly clear

I am glad I took  with Kagawa sensei She really knows what she is doing and is so excited about it There are many quizzes and homework but they are designed to help you learn and I am amazed at how much I learned in the end of the semester She does have high expectations but if you put in enough effort you will definitely get an A 
Very good professor The hardest Japanese lecturer Ive had yet but Ive learned so much in this semester that it was all worth it Shes hilarious and caring Most peoples complaints about her is her relatively harsh grading but she goes over what you have to have answered and if you just remember to keep that in mind its not too bad 
Just like the rest of the Japanese professors at Tufts Kagawasensei is absolutely great Dont be afraid of her she may come off as strict but she really wants you to succeed She definitely helped me perfect certain tricky grammar nuances HOWEVER unlike other sensei Kagawa gives you  for attendance if you skip a class due to sickness

I took this class as a freshman which likely made my experience different because I did not have a clear direction for the research project the goal of the class She has great tidbits about societal phenomena and Im sure shed be amazing in her field but this class was just not well organized and relied on student proactivity 
Not at all open to alternative views Stuck up rigid but an easy grader Dont expect much out of her class you will be asked to blindly repeat stale PoliSci formulas for historical analysis 
Not the friendliest lady and her paper requirements are very specific But all around I enjoyed her class She is very knowledgeable about revolutions and history I wouldnt have a beer with her but Id listen to her ramble on about pre communist Chinese society any day 
Refuses to help students Started off the semester really liking her but ended up severely disappointed in the end Regretted taking her class 
Very passionate about her subject good lectures Only thing I had a problem with was that her assignments mostly promts seemed unclear and confusing and when asking a question to clarify answers were often vague Otherwise good class readings are interesting and work load is manageable and interesting Easy to talk too helpful 
Fairly clear cut class not too difficult Just follow the directionsoutline 
She is EXCELLENT I learned a huge amount One of the best lecturers at Tufts She is funny enthusiastic and very helpful She loved her subject and it shows She puts a lot of time and energy into each class and knows everyone by name Would recommend to anyone 
She leads lively discussion and very helpful when you seek for help 
Remick is really great Not the easiest of classes but she really knows the material and cares about your progress Assessments are fair and you will get plenty of feedback along the way Engaging and clear lectures made class worth going to even though its mandator and I couldnt imagine doing well without attending Overall a really solid prof 
Remick is a fantastic professor deeply passionate about China and Chinese politics ridiculously knowledgeable and helpful and fluent in Chinese to boot She cares if her students understand uses inclass skits and movies to enhance understanding Midterm and final are both short essays One large paper Great class 
Professor Remick is great This was my first ever poli sci class and it was challenging yet still comprehensible and not impossible to get an A Her lectures were super interesting and she was very helpful in OHs and in her notes on papers Totally recommend Remick 
Papers always had tons of helpful comments on them She was super helpful in OH although you are wasting your time if you dont go prepared Assignments seem hard but with effort are not impossible Did well in the class by keeping up with readings and really taking part in class lectures Remick is very passionate and well versed in the subject 
Took Remick for another course before this loved it and got a relatively easy A But Comp Revolution is really difficult to get a high grade in Very rigid requirements and not enjoyable readingassignments at all In general I like Remick a lot as a professor  shes very nice and funny  but dont take PS  
Very clear and intelligent lecturer Obviously passionate about her subject 
Shes so into her material and shes great at teaching it If you are interested in what she has to say you can learn a lot Very kind and friendly and easy to talk to 
This was the worst class I have ever taken It was treated as a history class and methodology was an afterthought We had rigid outlines for our papers that we had to follow and ridiculously short page limits If you are interested in a class where you can zone out go for it but if you want to learn anything at all never take Remick 
Shes very nice and wants the students to understand the material shell go as slowly as necessary There is no syllabus which makes planning ahead difficult she announces exams a week before However I loved this class and learned a lot Reading medieval italian was challenging but she goes through it almost word by word 
Approachable and fun but runs a tough Italian class 
while the class early it lit is interesting one it is very difficult due to the old italian style she is a good teacher going over information repeatedly but she expects too much from her students my biggest problem with her and the class was the complete lack of a syllabus BIG problem if you have no idea what she said or missed a class 
nice lady but very strict 
She is a wonderful professor She goes as slowly as necessary for complete understanding Ive spent a semester in Italy and her teaching style is typical of a university professor in Italy She works with students individually on final projects  Tests are not that bad but you NEED to go to class

Schub is a really nice person and a pretty easy grader She is pretty good at leading discussions although the discussions were often pretty boring usually just summarizing what happened in the story and not going into any sort of deep analysis Shes encouraging with speaking and even bought us nice cheese and baguettes for the last day

Okay teacher I wasnt very interested in the lit we were reading but I guess she made the most of it I think she could have brought the conversations to a deeper level though at the least she definitely cares about her students and will be flexible with your situation 
So nice and really helpful She actually cares about her students and yup she always brings in cheese and baguettes on the last day of class A lot of reading and fairly lengthy essays but thats what youre signing up for with a  level FR class 
Fun spunky and understanding about deadlines Interesting class discussions which keeps class from being boring Pretty fair grader but grades according to personal improvement

Professor Shapero is a really astute and engaging teacher Her class nurtured my love for poetry and my understanding of it and gave me the tools to write my own Great class Would highly recommend taking it if you love analyzing and writing poems 
I took Education and Culture with Professor LeondarWright She was extremely knowledgable about the information and very open to discussion She did a great job of intertwining students personal experiences with the information we read about I would love to take another class with her 
McLeod turned one of the classes I most looked forward to into a nightmare I learned almost nothing during lectures I can tell that she cares about teaching but the way she presents material could not be more unhelpful She would go through all the material very quickly without simplifying anything Overall not a good teacher 
Horrible professor in every way other than the fact that she enjoys teaching and what not Just avoid taking a class with her at all costs 
VERY very nice teacher She is extremely willing to help but isnt always necessarily helpful 
She is WONDERFUL I love her to death She shares herself with the class ie stories of raising two kids as a single mother having breast cancer all while teaching spanish clearly and concisely The classroom atmosphere is relaxed but attentive Her tests are fair and as hard as all the other Spanish  exams Truly buena gente 
Nice woman Not a great teacher Class work doesnt follow syllabus I worry that I wont be prepared for the next level She also has a lot of health issues obviously not her fault that make her miss class a lot which detracts from the productiveness of the course Shes a nice woman but its not worth your tuition  to take her class 
she knows her stuff for sure but is not very open to other views especially if youre an amateur at analyzing films the films get better as the semester progresses but she assigns way too many readings theres a required film response to every movie we watch and three page papers 
Great teacher Class very informative and interesting even for nonfilm people Films do get kind of long however Few graded assignments but fair grading I very much enjoyed this class and teacher 
Professor Zhong inspired me to become a film major This class and the films we watched were a thorough revelation even though the films were sometimes quite hard to watch But you wont regret it 
This was a pretty awful class The movies she chose were boring we read essays written by her and she gave unclear and usually had very few valuable points in her lectures The workload was light and it didnt require too much brainwork I would fall asleep multiple times in one class and when I was awake I saw other people sleeping   
Brilliant mind somewhat wandering lectures For me I like organizationespecially when grappling with complex ideas like philosophy and Confucianism So I appreciate her brilliance and williness to challenge students but found lectures very hard to follow 
Assigns too many readings that are never discussed in class Lectures had almost nothing to do with the films and were three hours long Her grading is also pretty random 
Class time alternates between screening and lecture days Lecture days could be exhausting but were valuable The films were excellent the readings interesting if underused and the professor had interesting comments and encouraged class participation Not the best class but I enjoyed it Dont take if you dont really enjoy discussing film 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
If youre going to take a class with Zhong LaoShi make it a film class I enjoyed her fim choices for the most part in Chinese Film but now in Youth and Culture in Modern China I am unimpressed The lectures are repetitive and rambling making it hard to want to do the readings Lots about this class falls short

I thoroughly enjoyed her class The films were mostly interesting and even when they werent the analysis lecture gave them new meaning It isnt a ton of work you just have to be diligent and use your time wisely when youre watching the films so you have enough insight to write the weekly response The professor always kept convos interesting

She is average at best I took a film class with her a few semester back and the class is mostly watching film plus writing a really long responses every week Lots of readings Lectures are her rambling off  And her grading is extremely uninformative She always said good but the course grade turned out what you did not expect from the feedbacks 
Really great professor I really enjoyed this class and think of the films often She is obviously very intelligent and very willing to help you outside class

Professor Feilen is a sweet lady to talk to outside of class but her lecture style needs some improvement She lectures off of the slides mostly but not all information will be on the slide and is not the most animated public speaker Assessments are varied which is good so no one assessment counts for too much

You will definately brush up on your Latin grammar Merzlak seems to be somewhat distant at first but if you talk to her for a few minutes totally different story Nice lady and knows her Latin 
shes pretty old and kind of boring but she loves the material which is pretty much what makes classics of greece bearable that and the fact that its incredibly easy if you do the reading and show up to class most of the idiots in the class dont 
easy interesting reading strict teaching dont be late or go to the bathroom during class time she will not let you move a quiz or exam unless youre sick 
If you get to know her she is really nice and helpful Her teaching style is not like the people in English but give her a chance you can get a lot out of the course She really wants you to feel the literature She has published  books of poetry 
Boring and tests require very specific information The professor barely enriches the text so you could read them on your own and have almost the same intellectual experience without the agonizing boredom 
I have had Merzlak for several courses including Classics of Greece Latin  and her summer course on Ovid She is much better in Latin and the Ovid course The Ovid course in the summer is great 
She is very nice but very old You must follow her explanations of the text for her tests and you should write down anything word in the text that she references or explains Her class is fairly easy but her tests look for strict answers and she does not give double jeopardy 
She is an EXTREMELY nice prof w a phd from Harvard that LOVES the material Just read the assignments make sure you know what she tells you to know When it comes to test time just write what she told you One of the most straight forward classes at Tufts Read the material attend each class take half decent notes and it is an easy A 
Merzlak is SO nice She is a really sweet old lady That said she is very rigid structurally and alternate interpretations of the text bewilder her She doesnt seem to know anything about it other than what is written in our edition of the Metamorphoses She knows that REALLY well though 
Nuit is an active critic and historian which strengthens her teaching and separates her from the art history professors Ive had who seem to have little pertinent knowledge outside of a classroom Easily my favorite academic professor during my four years at the SMFA 
Professor Banai is the best art history teacher at Tufts 
dont get lost in the art speak seriously this woman knows her stuff dont be late unless you want to be scolded 
Noit is brilliant best Art History teacher ever Shes a cogent and funny lecturer and she loves to hear what you think The only criticism is that she sometimes speaks faster than I can write 
Best teacher at Tufts  brilliant funny and in absolute command of a difficult body of material Im an undergrad and I didnt mind traveling to take this class but its a shame that Art History graduate students have to audit Prof Banai would lend glamour to anyones PhD degree PhD students shouldnt be penalized from taking her classes 
She definitely knows her stuff but is rushed to help students understand it in terms that we can understand Her critical art background is her main objective but hardly puts the art in context I dont recommend her class if you dont have the time to read  pages of intense critical reading per week 
Professor Banai is extremely engaging always seeking her students opinions criticisms and interpretations She is very intelligent and presents herself in an interesting and diverse manner ienot monotone The tests were extremely reflective of the information we covered Its easy to get lost in the terminology but dont worry Shell help

Proffesor Sullivan is great She is funny and always has stories to tell The work load is not too bad There is  pages of reading a week three exams and a  page research paper

Props for trying to make a dry subject entertaining I think I wouldve fell asleep in lecture a lot more than I did if anyone else was teaching it You dont really need to read the text  all you need is in the lectures However theres quite a bit of fluff between the bits f information you need to know

Professor Roy is the worst professor I have had at tufts Her teaching policy consists of taking advantage of her authority and being intolerant of opinions that disagree with her own You can do well if you spit her opinion back out to her She wont tell you the grading system you just get a grade at the end 
This course was fantastic The literature and lectures really made this experience Roy is absolutely halarious and if you get to know her she has amazing stories to share A teacher who knows how to teach what a concept

Modhumita Roy a wonderful professor a brilliant scholar a fascinating woman and a godawful advisor 
Professor Roy is a fantastic teacher Her class is engaging and very eyeopening The texts covered are very diverse and well worth the fast paced reading schedule a novel a week She does a very good job encouraging discussion amongst a fairly large group of people is very acceping of differing viewpoints She really cares about her students 
Witty and fun Leads a good discussion She once gave me a ride to the T station 
Roy has a great sense of humor She has an attendance policy which I hate I wish she has allowed for more class discussion but overall it is a very good course 
This class is great Not too hard but you learn a lot Modhumita is so nice and funny Shes a little scatterbrained but in an endearing way The books are interesting and if you dont have time one week you can skip some reading every now and then TAKE THIS CLASS

This prof made a class that is supposed to be for learning a language about struggling to obtain a good grade instead She gives feedback on papers and then later will take points off when that advice is heeded later on Not all of the material on our final had been covered Not always available for office hours they are not useful

Didnt give good feedback and graded assessments too hard Papers were not bad except she would take points off for things we did not learn yet It was French  and she taught it like we knew the language a lot more It was helpful she tried keeping class to just French but she was bad at explaining grammar There are better Tufts French teachers 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
Please actually take this advice and do not take a class by this professor Not only does she not care about the class itself but she does not care about grades what so ever I spent the entire semester doing every homework on time and to the best of my ability NEVER GRADED Did not keep on top of anything and tests are not about lecture at all 
She is genuinely concerned with the progress of her students and tries to make the class interesting Though If you are trying to get exempt from ENG  it will not happen she does not believe in As 
Its definitely not an easy class But Claudia is an amazing person She is funny and helpful 
Petrovs a pretty good Russian teacher She uses the textbook a lot in class and the workbook for homeworks The homework takes up a decent amount of time The tests arent too hard if you study and she grades nice enough One MAJOR problem is that she holds us as much as seven minutes after class so I would always be late for my next class 
Teaches directly from the book and rarely ventures from it making classes boring and hard considering how badly laid out the book is They expect a much higher lvl of russ in the exams far above anything nancy will ever be capable of teaching If you have a choice dont pick her 
I love Nancy She is super nice and laid backengages students While the work load is pretty rough she is very understanding and a lenient grader Definitely take the course 
Had her for Russian  and  Russian is hard and she wasnt much help clearing it up In Russian  she was easier on grading but I did not learn the language well 
Thoroughly mediocre language professor Shes helpful and sweet but the class is not particularly wellorganized or challenging Russian language on the other hand is VERY difficult and this class and her others are not rigorous enough 
Otlychno Excellent Very kind always helpful and really concerned with her students progress Very helpful in learning Russian not that hard a language actually and really interested in her subject Couldnt ask for more

Iryna is great She really cares about her students Her lectures were very well organized and you could refer back to them online if she rushed through something Do lots of the practice problems that she provides Quiz every other week but if you review the lecture slides they will be a nice grade booster since her exams are hard 
Jennifer is really sweet and understanding She also has a lot of public health experience and tells stories in class that help the information to stick The only downside to CH was the organization of the class Seeing as how it was Jen and Matts first time teaching the course I would think that next year itll be much better 
SO MANY PAPERS 
Professor Allen does care about helping her students and the subject matter at hand However she could be more organized and convey the material better Peerreviewed literature which makes up the majority of outside reading isnt easy to get through or terribly informative and the essays are not cakewalks The tests arent too bad

Allen is wonderfully caring and wants her students to succeed but not so great of a lecturer Sometimes gets confused by her own slides Recitation can be pointless but is mandatory She really wants her students to do well though and if you see her during office hours shes an angel

CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA 
As far the class itself is concerned Intro Community Health is ridiculously easy There is really no necessity to go to class or recitation other than participation credit in recitations which isnt even participation its just attendance As for Dr Allen shes really approachable but lectures are incredibly boring Overall incredibly easy

Professor Allen is very sweet and enthusiastic but it doesnt always translate into engaging lectures She is very knowledgeable about PH and passionate but in part because its a survey course classes felt disjointed and a little disorganized She is still a great mentor and inspired me to take more CH classes in the future so to Matt 
SO MANY PAPERS 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
I absolutely hated this class I was considering a community health major and this class completely ruined that for me It was disorganized there were two main papers the quizzes were filled with trick questions and all three lecturers Matt Professor Allen and Stransky turned out to be three of my least favorite professors of all time 
Nice lady but really a pretty terrible teacher She is SO unorganized She rushes through everything and we never learn any real material She let the TA or guest speakers teach most of the time who were just as bad Tests were a joke and Im pretty sure they didnt even read our final  page papers Super easy class awful to sit through 
Professor Allen is a little bit all over the place in her lectures and every class begins with a fifteen minute technology struggle Shes smart but not cut out well for teaching students Writing assignments are confusing

This is a relatively easy class to take at Tufts although Professor Allen is not a great lecturer her and the TAs give a clear grading criteria for their papers 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Although Allen is good the head TA Matt was most competent in teaching the class Allen reads off the powerpoints that Matt creates and although she is competent in her field she tries to be too politically correct and teaches too slowly The material is interesting though and I recommend taking the class 
She went beyond the call of duty to make me a better student I was inspired by her passion and grace 
I graduated but she is awesome she was my advisor and really good friend We shared Armenian History She rocks 
Her class was easy but miserably boring Prepare to spend the first half of the semester on colonial trading routes then the nd half on why GMO foods suck Theres no logical progression or framework to the class you just learn a lot of random crap that vaguely has to do with consumption and watch Sofia Coppola movies Blech 
Professor McCabe is one of the kindest professors you will ever encounter She is understanding and willing to devote time to her students She has an obvious passion for the material which she passes on to you I hope to have her as a professor again

i graduated last may professor mccabe was both my history advisor and professor she was so knowledgable helpful and always made time for her students she was very accessible and open one of the best professors i had at tufts 
The class I was supposed to be in was intermediate to advanced painting However last minute it got combined with foundation painting There was little difference in the way she treated both groups Her critiques were unbearable not because she was tough but mostly bc she always critiqued things asked her for help on  she said were fine 
Maybe Prof Levin can paint but she cannot teach She was never clear with her comments and was never completely honest in her assessment of my painting until her final commentsafter the semester had endedsuper helpful I am very frustrated after receiving a grade that I think I could have improvedIF ONLY ID KNOWN WHAT TO WORK ON 
She is a decent teacher I think for those without previous art experience like me Her class is very unstructured and she gives more general guidelines than any real instructions She tries to work with individual strengths rather than forcing students into a particular style Most of the class is a kind of learn as you paint philosophy 
Unstructured teaching style For a class that is supposed to be a painting foundation class she had extremely high standards despite the fact that she didnt teach any techniques This class is combined wthe intermediate painting class which probably contributes to her high expectaions I felt that my GPA got penalized for trying something new 
Not helpful during class and gives low grades considering its an art class

Davis is a great teacher She is extremely nice and helpful  I would definitely recommend taking spanish with her 
Great professor wonderful asset to the Romance Language Department Shes small and spunky and dresses really well doesnt look her age AT ALL Wonderful professor though class by nature is dull 
Caring and helpful professor Easy to contact even outside of office hours Gives students extensions if necessary like when all of your exams seem to be on the same day but you have that spanish paper to write Understands that her class is not the only one youre taking Such a sweet woman  
Psych Stats was extremely easy but she went way too fast in class Dont plan on copying everything down from her Powerpoints She seems like a sweetheart I never went to office hours so I dont know what shes like oneonone but she definitely has some pet peeves that get her every now and then 
Stats is a boring subject as is and you need someone who is enthusiastic but also a good lecturer to entice you Unfortunately Sloboda does not meet these qualifications The class if a bore and she seems really nice and sweet but paying attention is impossible Not to mention labs are a waste of time 
She cant keep the attention of students in any of her lectures She tries very hard to be funny but isnt Poorly organized class when it comes to homework and labs The labs are way too short for the allotted time slot and it eliminated my ability to take other classes Her slides tend to have errors on them and arent corrected when uploaded

She can be a bit scattered but she does present the material well Shes not boring because shes so energetic passionate about statistics which is important since stats has the potential to be dry If you go to lab you have to and understand the homework you should do well on the tests study the slides too Very nice prof 
Psych Stats with Sloboda was not difficult She allowed open book and notes though you had to know the material going into the test The labs were a breeze but homeworks pretty tough Sloboda was extremely helpful during the course and truly wanted to help every student as best she could outside of class and during tests Quality professor 
Though there is a general consensus that Psych Stats is one of the easiest math credits at Tufts Slobodas teaching makes it harder than it needs to be She goes too fast in class and doesnt clearly explain the more difficult concepts that will be on the exam With that in mind the class is structured to be pretty easy 
Great professor Very approachable Very good lecturer entertaining and engaging the class especially for a large lecture hall she was very interesting Not too much reading but enough to reinforce lectures Obviously extremely intelligent but not going to make up answers when she wasnt sure of a question Definitely recommend psych 
Marci will not mince words Her feedback has been invaluable to me she has an incredible grasp of what works and what doesnt I am a better writer thanks to her 
Marcie gave me extremely valuable advice and her class made me a better writer I did feel however that the semester grade came out of no where but I think the experience and advice I got out of the class during the semester was worth getting a grade that was a little lower than I was expecting 
Very fun class Captivating stereotypical English professor Wish there was more writing and less editing of other peoples weird stories 
She knows what she wants to hear from students so creativity seems to be ok but lowers your gradewhich you dont know till you get it on your transcript Instead of teaching she enjoys reading stories and plays favorites Fairness is not her strength neither is creative writing Not a good teacherTake her if you dont care about your grade 
GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK 
TOUGH GRADER 
She has extremely high expectations and makes you work VERY hard You WILL become a better writer but that may come at the expense of a lower grade than you would have anticipated The class is very engaging However she very rarely assigns prompts so it can be difficult to come up with things to write about 
The assignments games and stories we had in class were excellent in inspiring good writing Also she was personally very encouraging and helpful 
She is a great professor and will definitely help you become a better writer However this class is NOT a grade booster Youll work really hard and have to be ok with a B 
Worst teacher Ive had at Tufts Unfair grades unprepared for class and horrible workshop style class 
She knows exactly what she wants from your writing and wont budge until it looks like she wants it to Its best to just accept as early as possible that she will have the final say in grades so you shouldnt be stubborn even if you dont agree with her That said she is very helpful and the class is small and fun but it is NOT an easy A

She loves creative writing and is good at it Her creativity is amazing but she cannot convey it to her students Her demands are not related to what she teaches and her endofthesemestersurprise grades have nothing to do with the body of writing produced its based on sympathy Watch out 
Fun class 
Attendance is absolutely mandatory and being on a sports team is not an excuse I learned this during class that my grade would suffer were to miss class for games That being said Marcie seemed like a brilliant teacher and a great person with an expansive lexicon Just wanted to put out a disclaimer for other athletes or people in clubs etc

I took Mythology last semester and thought that Beaulieu was already a great prof But after taking Journey of the Hero I love her even more The class focuses on fairy tales and legends across the ages and focuses on classics like the grimms tales Harry Potter Star Wars and Lord of the Rings Such an interesting class and a must take class 
BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES

Your grade is mostly based on whether you get a hard or easy TA The grading criteria is vague and youre never given a clear description of what is expected so it is extremely difficult to succeed unless you already know a great deal of Mythology and are knowledgable in classics

Professor Beaulieu was incredible Her lectures are interesting and engaging even if she goes off on a brief tangent its relevant and she knows exactly what shes talking about The pop quizzes are mostly based on the lectures even small details but the majority of your grade is a group research paper I highly recommend any of her courses 
This professor is malicious ignorant and completely awful to work with Her teaching skills are poor and very inadequate for such a high caliber school like Tufts I hope I never have an encounter with her again 
Poor teacher  she was more confused about class content than our class Has no basic understanding of how a college class should be conducted 
unless you really think youre into human factors STAY AWAY fell into this class as an electiveshould have droppedIMMEDIATELY 
Turned me off from minoring in human factors Though she tried to be helpful and flexible it really didnt make things any more understandable Dont take a class with her unless you have to 
Tries to pawn of a cognitiveindustrial psychology curriculum as Human Factors Maybe that worked in Canada but not here Does not belong in the Mechanical Engineering department 
This guy has no idea what she is talking about The class became students teaching themselves I cant help wondering how she can be still here and get funding Really somthing amazing in academia 
SHE IS REALLY A BAD TEACHER SHE ALWAYS MAKES EVERYTHING HARDER 
boring class bad lecturer not useful 
This course didnt have many tricky concepts but when there were questions she didnt seem to know the answers It seemed like lectures were hastily prepared and she really didnt care about teaching When we went over a lengthy problem on the midterm she kept messing up showing us that she didnt even know how to do the work she assigned 
Shes really not that bad at allher lectures get a little boring and the projects are usually very unclearbut the problem sets are not insanely difficult and the tests are pretty easy too 
Really Prof Cao isnt as bad as everyone makes her sound Yes classes are boring straight from a powerpoint But they lectures are structured and she knows a ton about human factors However she doesnt have enough time to plan out projects so theyre a little lackingconfusing But ENP  isnt too bad overall plus its pretty easy 
fairly easy class just act confused and lost which you probably will be and shes usually accommodating she moved our midterm exam to our final exam date almost a month later and pushed our project due date back one week 
Shes one odd bird This is the second time Ive tried to take a course with her the first time she was really snobby and told everyone in the class that theyd better know XYZ before coming in otherwise she didnt know what they were doing in her course even though it had NO prerequsite Beware 
Professor McTighe is an amazing teacher She is incredibly intelligent and is a great lecturer She does expect a lot from her students Tests are challenging but fair If anyone is interested in learning more about modern and contemporary art she is the professor to take a class with Contemporary Art was the best FAH class I took at Tufts 
I greatly enjoyed McTighes lectures and learned a surprising amount of new information about topics that I had already studied both independently and in other classes I failed because I slept through the final exam I did fine on the midterm though it just took an hour or so of studying the night before And no shes not actually a snob 
Im an Art Hist major and shes the only prof I ever had who propogated the snobby art person stereotype Strangely would openly tell us that she didnt know anything about certain topics but then try to impress us with her knowledge of modern art Just unclear then graded really hard hard to communicate with Def my only class with her

Vida is amazing take her Russian Film course and have a great time discussing movies you will most likely be viewing for the first time Very interesting and Vida always has something worthwhile to add without stifling the class discussion 
Prof Johnson is very nice as long as you come to class She brings snacks every day and she has a ridiculous amount of knowledge on the subject so I learned a lot Lots of great films some not so good but great class overall You have to keep a film journal and write a paper for the midterm The textbook Understanding Movies is not necessary 
a truly interesting class that proved to be way more fun than I anticipated Ambrogio is an engaging lecturer who cares about the topic as much as she cares about the students understanding of it Tests are easy as long as you regularly attend lectures Great class

Cruz is absolutely brilliant Ive taken both her political violence course and political culture seminar One of few professors in the polysci department that teaches undergrads complex theory and does so very well Very approachable at office hours You must work hard in her classes but its worth it 
Narrowminded will lead discussions concerning theory that never move beyond a superficial level Class basically was a waste of time 
sometimes the theory is a little dense and the readings boring but cruz herself is amazing lively engaging brilliant personable its true she has her favorites but its because they make themselves known to her she def makes the class worth it 
Consuelo Cruz is brilliant When you start off the class sometimes the readings can feel disjointed However as you move through the class you realize they all play a perfect role in the scheme shes unveiling She has a great sense of humor She really cares about what you say in class  listens carefully I loved every second of the class 
On the first day of class she said she was not going to post her lecture notes as an incentive for people to come to class Fair enough The problem is her lectures are confusing and boring The board looks like a word map by the end of class with no structure Cant believe she is paid the same as other professors at Tufts

Funny witty smart and a fantastic lecturer Absurd amount of reading but she makes it worth it her class is great and I would definitely take again If you want to learn about Latin America or statebuilding theories Cruz is the one to turn to 
LECTURE HEAVY 
GET READY TO READ 
HILARIOUS 
She is not an easy professor but she is SO worth taking a class with I was amazed by her on the first day of class and still amazed when we ended Incredibly helpful and caring really wants you to succeed and will help you do so Her lectures can be hard to follow and the reading is intense but shes there to help you as long as you ask 
Horrendous Is more concerned about being liked by the students than actually teaching Papers are graded by TAs who dont care dont write comments dont do anything Shell assign papers asking for one thing and then grade them on criteria different than what she asked for Always min late 
Cruz can be hit or miss On a bad day her lectures are a bit dry and hard to pay attention to On a good day which is more often her lectures are interesting and dynamic Her accent is hard to understand at times but otherwise she is very clear and concepts are easily understood  papers make the grade each of which are pretty straightforward 
Prof Cruz knows what shes talking about shes a very engaged lecturer and uses all of the articles she assigns Papers are graded by the TA she is not that approachable Very big on participation 
this class was a waste I learned nothing primarlily because the readings are unclear and too theory oriented 
She is a nice teacher engaging lectures but yeah she picks on people has her favorites and basically promotes a very selfish materialistic way of viewing the world along with being a pinochet apologist and promoter of neoliberalism its r

I began the class and was at first very uncomfortable with the material but ended up with a newfound understanding of philosophy and respect for my professor

Ethical theory was a great class that made me think in a whole different way I was fine even though I had not taken intro ethics The amount of work is perfect   papers and  discussion posts enough to make me do the reading and understand the material but not so much that it was overwhelming at all Perfect highly recommend 
Estevan is a horrible professor She uses mindless powerpoints and stumbles over the simplest words with an incomprehensible accent You could learn everything in her class from reading the textbook and youd be better served talking to a homeless guy than going to her office hours A shameful professor for a renowned Econ program 
Granted all the EC professors are not top notch shame on you tufts but from what i heard out of all the alternatives shes probably the best her powerpoints followed the book making class not a huge necessity She took time to explain stuff like the financial crisis though Her accent not actually that bad 
lectures were dynamic but not at all related to the mass amounts of material we were tested on Her lecturing style would be better suited for a kindergarden audience than a college one 
Fantastic professor She radiates with enthusiasm for human development Not the best with personal communication but she attempts to learn every students name in the lecture Made me want to major in CD Try to get lunch with her listen to her life story Read the textbook for information and listen to her for inspiration 
very enthusiastic and good intentions but lectures are soetimes scattered thank god for TAs Ellen is the best 
She was interesting but it was hard to keep up with her sometimes 
Shes a great professor 
Although nice some material is irrelevant and she grades too hard 
LOVE HER Take this class with her or with gidney they are both amazing lecturers She LOVES what she teaches and that makes all the difference She is energetic and passionate and the TAs this year were AMAZINGLY helpful They really outlined the textbook since the lecture is not based on the book but are used to supplement the readings 
Not only is she a great teacher shes inspirational 
she knows everything and is so passionate and interesting to listen to Really worthwhile course 
Incredibly disorganized lecturer Her enthusiasm while popular with many students often seems flaky and annoying I feel like Im sitting in a gradeschool classroom I prefer being spoken to like an adult not a child Her TA Kevin is wonderful though 
Professor Wolf is unbelievable This course is the best course Ive taken at Tufts I love this woman 
Prof Wolf is great her lectures are entertaining and the course is well structured If you do your work its an easy grade 
A really enthusiastic and fun prof But her lectures are all over the place Its really hard to organize what she says Ellen is a great TA though 
She was definitely enthusiastic but quite disorganized The grading on the final was erratic I did not enjoy her as a teacher but everyone else I talked to did 
Wolf is easily the best teacher in the CD dept 
She is an excellent professor The class is hard and there is alot of material to cover but she makes it fun She is very enthousiasitic and it challenges us to keep up Its nice to have a professor who makes an effort to know every student 
Material is very interesting but she makes it even more so by her enthusiasm and encouraging class participation Hard to keep up w sometimes 
Lessons were great but then what we had to learn was all jumbled it was real unclear Little disorganized 
Prof Wolf was a great lecturer She made everything seem interesting engaging the class at every turn She is definitely my most memorable professor to date 
AMAZING teacher Changed the course of my life So so so enthusiastic and interesting I would highly recommend the intro to child development class but be prepared to learn The workload is really intense but so very worth it 
She is so passionate about what she does The class can be interesting but you may feel left out if youre not one of those many students who is madly in love with children Also the TAs were not that good The review sessions were absolutely HORRIBLE 
Shes nationally known as an expert on learning disabilities however when it comes to having a student with disabilities in her class shes at a complete loss She seems to see LD as something to be researched and examined under a microscope but has no patience for actual students in her class afflicted with these same conditions 
Did not enjoy as a teacher 
Very enthusiastic 
I will quote professor kilmer who said on the first day when I took linear algebra I didnt like it very much but when I took numerical linear algebra everything changed or something like that 
Prof Kilmer is an awesome professor to have for Math  I heard my friends complain about the other professors but she is extremely clear and helpful in explaining the difficult parts of the class and homework problems 
Very very nice Good lecturer too 
Difficult class with difficult assignments but doable Go to office hours for help shes more than willing to help anyone 
Really good lecturer  very clear and organized Very sweet cares a lot about the material and uses good examples of linear algebra applications Very good class

If you speak up during class and participate youll get a good grade Overall shes a great professor and she does a good job explaining the grammar concepts 
Gillette is a really good professor and an interesting person but her classes are extremely vocab heavy and she often doesnt clearly outline what she expects of you Gradewise it is fine but just a lot of busy work and a never ending supply of new words to learn and small tasks to do 
Gillettes a very clear and helpful teacher She speaks very clearly The class is pretty easy except that I find it hard to participate enough 
Great professor helpful warm and very friendly easy to talk to always willing to see you or help out i really enjoyed french class tests are quite hard though you need to know everything and you need to be prepared for classes by reading over the material and knowing it very well 
Mme Gillette is by far the best French professor Ive had at Tufts I think one of the best aspects of hte class was that she is FRENCH so it was great to learn how they really speak in Paris She uses the book a lot so be sure to do your homeworkbut a lot of the time she lets students ask whatever questions they want if they dont understand 
Fantastic teacher  clear energetic and always willing to review and explain as well as drop in tidbits of French culture 
awesome so helpful and so nice 
Mme Gillette est une merveilleuse professeure Shes very enthusiastic warm and motivated I really got the sense that she cares about her teaching and you as a student Shes French so has a great accent but she is still really clear about explaining grammar to languagelearners I would definitely recommend taking her class 
soo nice Not the clearest in the world but you can get by with a decent grade Just know that orals count a lot 
She is a wonderful teacher also enthusiastic A good deal of work but thats expected Definitely take her class 
Gillette is such a nice teacher and explains things well She loves participation so make sure to speak up It was a good pace for me but for more ambitious french learners her class may not be challenging enough 
Marie Gillette is pretty much the nicest lady ever She really cares about how well her students do and she is always available for help She is a strict but fair grader and if you study you should easily get a good grade Plus she has an awesome Parisian accent  
Enthusiastic and clear made sure the students understood the material made the class fun would definitely take her class again

Mme Gillette is a great French teacher She treats her students like adults but still wants to help them succeed Shes a fair grader and paying attention in class gives you everything you need to know to succeed Definitely recommend her 
Its amazing to learn French from an actual French person She uses the book a lot but she explains everything clearly and is extremely fair 
Shes a very gifted teacher and super knowledgable of language Orals do count a lot but she actually wants you to speak French rather than just write it 
so helpful native of France so knows language very well and can help you w everything you dont understand very nice and caring as well 
Easy grader easy A Great person but grammar is kind of boring 
She is a phenomenal teacher and encourages her students to discuss everything from grammar to the books read in class to the movies watched or just French life and culture like how to deal with forward French men Shes amazing and definitely my favourite professor at Tufts so far 
I agree that she is extremely nice and cares about the students but I found that the course clarity isnt so good I find that she grades a little too harsh on orals for elementary french I 
Mme Gillette is everything a french teacher should be She is always in a good mood makes weird facial expressions and encourages the class to speak in class She is very forgiving about work and is a pretty fair grader The only things I could ever complain about are that she is usually a few minutes late and doesnt emphasize vocab enough 
Active style of teaching Lots of drills for speaking expects a lot of busy work Doesnt create a great environment for learning because she gets angry if her students dont answer right away Pretty stressful come class time 
Prof Perricone is great She is one of the best professors at Tufts She is very passionate about the topic and I really enjoyed her class 
isabella is great take her class 
SHE IS AMAZING take her classes shes the best italian teacher there is at tufts 
an awesome teacher shes kind ofscary at first but if you come to class prepared youll be fine shes good and makes you work 
Isabella is AWESOME Shes funny and caring and is simply fun to be around even at  in the morning If you take Italian try to take it with her 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Very good professor Really engaging in class and always willing to help the students 
She is one of Tufts gems 
Perricone is awesome 
Prof Perricone is a very intelligent prof but she does take Italian seriously If you are afraid to speak up in class dont take her class She can be intimidating but dont get discouraged Also tell her if you dont know the answer She will work with you 
Isabella presents a fun classroom environment but ofetn she is less prepared than her students If people are underprepared she skips the collegiate approach of giving a lower grade and ops for the middle school approach of yelling lecturing and guilt tripping Directions are often ambiguous and she will single out someone to pick on 
Perricone is AWESOME She is such a fun person and makes the class super enjoyable while you still learn a ton I learned more italian during one semester with her than i did of  years of spanish in high school Now Im even considering studying abroad in Italy take this class if you can 
So helpful and caring she really wants you to learn the language and do well And she really gets you awake 
RESPECTED 
TOUGH GRADER 
HILARIOUS 
Prof Perricone is a gem in the Italian department She demands respect and attention from her students but this is really the typical Italian style of teaching Ask her about her background as an actress in Italy if you show an interest in her she will give you that same respect and class will be very enjoyable 
I love Isabellas class Anyone who wants to take Italian should definitely start with her 
She was always really enthusiastic She is full of energy and seems to be breezing through things but in reality shes willing to stop and listen if you have questions 
Good Professor good research Kind of boring and hard to listen to in class

Great professor genuine nice person Ill be real here PSY  is a brutal class however its unfortunate that some students dislike her just from this class Ive taken  other courses with her and I loved them both Courses are very well organized with clear fair grading rubrics Also she really cares about all her students 
I only gave her an aboveaverage easiness rating because of how she scaled our final grades She was really nice but extremely boring and she treated us like childrenon the first day of class she used an animalsound icebreaker to get us to meet other students 
very average  nothing really sticks out in my mind about her 
She really knows how to make boring subject matter tolerable When she explained how certain experiments work she typically performed fake ones on us by giving out candy and asking our opinions on it She will listen to and use any feedback you give her Her tests are very fair 
Prof Urry is very concerned with everyones progress which often comes off as her treating students as younger than they are which isnt a problem more than being slightly annoying Class is straightforward and very interestingapplicable to real life The book is great Did a good job of mixing lecture with class discussion I learned a lot

She means well However when she teaches the class can drag on for what feels like hours In addition she doesnt really answer any questions in class like she tells people that she doesnt know the answer The lectures are pretty boring but she tries to make it entertaining Overall dont recommend 
Professor Urry was my least favorite of the three that teamtaught PSY  Sommers Shin She was prone to technical difficulties and she didnt present the information in enough detail for it to stick She also liked to put a ton of important text on a slide but skip to the next one before anyone was done copying

Professor Urry is really sweet and clearly cares a lot about her students success however I think she manages to make an already boring topic experimental psych even more boring Shes also very unclear on grading That being said its not too hard to get an A 
Professor Urry might not be the most popular but she does take pride in her teaching It is clear that she tries to make class engaging and that she wants her students to learn Even if the execution isnt always there she seeks feedback and actually listens to it Her class probably wont be your favorite class but it wont be too bad either 
Class is insanely boring but Prof Urry is very fair and her lectures are clear She is very concerned with students progress and is an enjoyable lecturer It is impossible to make this class interesting so for what she had to deal with I think she did a good job The lab for this course is the worst part Very time consuming and aggravating

Very active and fun in class Shes very hard on the grading but she tells you what you have to work on She tends to scare you with really bad grades on your first papers but your grade tends to move up really quickly as long as you do what she wants you to do Good but harsh 
Great teacher gets along very well with students 
not a good teacher not very flexible and is only looking for one type of paper boring class and not interesting paper topics pick another section 
She is a great teacher You can tell that she really loves what she does She is a very hard grader however Class is interesting and fununtil you have a workshop day those are brutal 
Picky grader and quite difficult but when you leave her class you will know how to write 
Great if you WANT to improve your writing She grades pretty hard but I ended up with a B by following what she taught She allowed rewrites on all papers for Eng  If you get less than an A go see her office hours she might require you to do this at least once I learned so much She is also very fun in class with good discussions 
Professor Whitney will improve your writing like it or not The  paper topics are unique even fun and that is basically all the work for the class She does grade rather harshly but is extremely helpful in one on one appointments which she encourages Classtime is fun and she goes along with the occasional tangent Not at all strict

Shes a great teacher who knows how to conduct class well and keep students engaged Class was held in a casual discussion style which made the atmosphere more relaxed and enjoyable 
The best class I have taken at Tufts so far She is so interesting her anecdotes brilliant and the material engaging Got off topic a lot but some of the conversations had in class I still think about today Very understanding when it comes to assignments and due dates Her classes are not to be missed 
I took her at UMASS AMHERST for a intro to writing class She inspired me to be the teacher I am today and the principal I am going to be She was a great teacher 
Shes very boring and monotonous Hard to listen to Doesnt provide very good guidance 
Has no idea how to teach and is unsure of herself in front of the class Do not take 
Terrible teacher wasted my time and the single reason I dropped Spanish Awful awful May God have mercy on her soul 
Sra Belansky is so nice and helpful She really cares about everyones understanding of the material I learned a lot from the class and didnt have a hard time in it If you study youll be fine She will willingly help you if you need it Shes not the best teacher ever but shes certainly not the worst 
She is usually at least five minutes late which is frequently a good thing SHe has a hard time keeping up with the syllabus and quickly fell several days behind Also forgot to assign some of the diarios which we had to complete at the last minute on top of other work Doesnt explain the grammar terribly well A nice enough person though 
I really dont understand some of these comments Yes Belansky uses the textbook a lot and is at times unclear However just ask and she will clarify She is a nice woman and sincerely wants her students to do well If you embrace her style of teaching you will leave the class a better spanish speaker 
Nice and earnest She seems like a great grandmother That said I was really disappointed in her class Disorganized terrible at explaining the crucial grammatical points the class is supposed to teach and didnt seem to care when folks spoke in English 
ummmm if i hadnt of taken three years of spanish before entering spanish  with this lady i would of been screwed she does not teach she reads out of the book if your taking her for  SWITCH OUT 
She is VERY disorganized Belansky fell behind in class very quickly and then rushed us through the subject matter to try to catch us up at the expense of our grades and comprehension of the language She forgot to assign assignments which we had to dohand in during reading period on top of finals This class is why I am not taking SP 
One of the worst Spanish teachers Ive ever had and as far as I can tell not an easy grader either If for some reason you find yourself taking her class try your best to switch outyoull be SO much happier 
She is wonderful and loving and kind I think that she was so helpful and really cared about her students and always gave extentions when needed I love her so much may more people take her class 
As a person harmless and kind As a teacher miserable and destructive Shes always willing to help although I question her ability to do so Teaches from the text boring as hell I found myslef hoping bio lab would run over so I could stay there instead of being in this awful class 
she is really nice her class is easy if you just do the hw assignments and learn the chapter vocab and grammar youll do fine on the tests i dont know why people are complaining about her there is a syllabus for spanish  and she follows it 
Ugh I am was really interested in learning Spanish but didnt like this class at all She is a nice lady but really flighty and always seems to have her head in a cloud I didnt feel that I learned much at all

Not quite sure what she wanted me to get out of it and I dont think she was sure either You spend a ridiculous amount of time doing arts and crafts projects that serve little use and I am no better off at illustrator than if I had learned it myself I constantly found myself googling illustrator tutorials in class 
Foundations of Design can and should be an awesome class Unfortunately Professor Breiner does not do much to inspire or educate students Most of the class is spent doing bland arts and crafts projects to learn design principles on a very superficial level Youre briefly exposed to Illustrator but not enough to actually get anything out of it 
She is an amazing professor She places emphasis on speaking which is one of the most important parts of language and isnt to hard on the written work She allows you to rewrite comps for a better grade and this really helps with the writing skills All in all shes fun engaging and makes going to class enjoyable  
shes an awesome teacher and really really makes the class great 
She is amazing Very energetic and helps you understand the material well by using her amazing teaching style Not very difficult as long as you just do your work Plus if you dont understand what she is saying her hand gestures and enthusiasm make understanding her a lot easier 
So much fun She is an extremely caring and giving person and she is willing to help you improve your grade if you mess up on an assignment She invited us over to her house at the end of the semester and made us all delicious Italian food Definitely a must take course from her 
Awesome prof very helpful very energeticReally knows her stuff 
She can be a little mean sometimes untentionally by picking on students in class Some lectures are unclear and her tests are poorly conceived She is not very helpful in her office hours and his very little time She does have enthusiam for the subject however 
LOVE Succeeding in this class isnt hard when you know the tricks Read the boxes in the textbook with realworld examples She loves those Also the people who come up with the theories matter as much as the theories She always stops for questions This is a really cool class Dont let the exam take you by surprise 
Shes really nice and knowledgeable The material she teaches is very interesting and the class really helped me gain an indepth understanding of international trade Her voice can be hard to hear sometimes so Id recommend to sit close to the front row 
Professor Brown is extremely kind and clearly passionate about her subject I enjoyed my class with her If you show up to class and do the very short weekly problemsets you can easily get an A in this class Sometimes lecture can feel a bit slow but just show up do the minimal homework take notes and youll be golden 
She is great The only thing I would say is that the problems on test are sometimes odd choices Its not like its something you havent learned or that is particularly difficult its just weird She is really smart and fun though and I am asking her to be my advisor 
Drusillas class will in fact kill your dreams Exams are unpredictable and are graded arbitrarily by TAs Professor Brown is extremely knowledgeable and can explain anything  on   the problem is getting to that scenario with  kids in the class 
A nice person but going to office hours doesnt really help 
I do not recommend taking EC with Professor Brown It was very disorganized lectures were boring and confusing quiztest questions were impossible to predict and quizzes were in Friday recitation Professor Brown is a genuinely nice person but this class was a complete mess 
Great Professor She knows A LOT about economics Class starts out a little slow but picks up later on Exam questions are out of the blue sometimes but not overly difficult 
Echoing a previous comment Professor Brown is very knowledgable but she is often hurried and frantic during interactions outside of class If you schedule a meeting with her remember to email her earlier that day to remind her otherwise she will forget Also assume that she will arrive to the meeting at least ten minutes late 
Always seems to busy to help much

Really passionate about the material and you can tell shes not out to get students and her exams are straightforward Extremely helpful if you take the initiative and reach out

She is an easy grader who gives a lot of softballs Her exams come from her power points and she will sometimes repeat questions from past exams She is passionate about what she does and makes the content pretty digestible and wants to make sure you know it 
Probably her first time teaching this course She was enthusiastic about the material but wasnt able to explain it well to the class She moves very fast which ends up with a lot of puzzled and lost faces in the lecture The class average for the first exam was a D The exam material was X more specific They call her Drusilla the Dream Killa

Prof Browns lectures are pretty interesting she talks a lot about the history and political context surrounding the concepts she discusses which really puts everything into perspective Exams were extremely easy if you do the problem sets and the practice exams She genuinely wants her students to succeed

She often asks students to check her arithmeticshe wants her students to do well but doesnt always communicate the material well Problem sets  midterms optional final

Emphasizes working with primary sources both written and textual Teaches you how to be a historian but guides you along the way this is a survey class after all She is super sweet and understanding of any concern whether academicrelated or not 
All the reading isnt necessary because she gives most of the information in her powerpoint She is a little dry because she reads off the screen but she incorporates a lot of popular culture into her lectures that makes the class really interesting The material is really interesting Does not require too much work outside of class 
Hands down one of the best professors at Tufts She is extremely helpful during office hours and genuinely cares about her students Always very enthusiastic about the course material Exams are very straightforward and most students do well If you are interested in Chinese history or culture she is definitely a professor that you want to know

One of the best profs at Tufts She cares so much about her students and their learning She is very helpful and super nice She is very passionate about what shes teaching and her enthusiasm is contagious I wish more professors at Tufts were like her Shes the best Tests and assigs are fair and very manageable

Russell is overall a very average teacher Her lectures are not quite mindblowing or outstanding from your average classes at Tufts However she is still very smart and helpful when providing her insight on the subject matter It is not hard to get an A in her class and she is easy going At the same time she doesnt care much about the class

Luo Laoshi is a very friendly woman As of this entry shes still relatively new at teaching and thus still has a bit to go before she can cement her teaching style but shes open to feedback Be prepared to practice speaking and listening in her class Maybe not the most inspirational but she does want to see you do well 
Lynn is absolutely PHENOMENAL She really works with each individual students needs is very accommodating appropriately so and provides lots of options ie midterm paper OR an assessment of children in real life final paper OR create a teacher handbook on a topic Patient genuinely interested and kind I HIGHLY recommend her classes 
Shes really nice and helpful but I think she needs to reign in some of the conversations in the large classes because theres so much material to cover and its hard to hear her insights since we go off on so many tangents 
One of the alltime best So helpful and sweet 
Really smart professor knows her material very well and ties lectures together cohesively Her enthusiasm for the content and unintimidating demeanor enable students to feel at ease in her class Although she is a difficult prof she is extremely fair I hope to take another class with her in the future 
Great professor knows her stuff cares about students Tends to assign WAY too much critical reading though Overall a fabulous professor 
Repetitive Not open to alternative views Talks over students I was very excited to learn about Brit lit but was disappointed by how bs some of her readings were and how defensive she becomes when they are questioned Her grading is unfair in that if you throw back at her what she says in class youll be fine but otherwise youre screwed 
I absolutely loved Frankensteins sisters with Hofkosh Shes organized and passionate about the material The whole concept of the class was refreshing and interesting and she did a great job facilitating class discussions Shes also very accessible outside of class to talk about papers classes anything 
Hofkosh is definitely encouraging of class envolvement shes sweet and shes enthusiastic However she barely references the text during class tends to get too bsy and can spend way too long discussing one topic Theres a lot of material survey course but you can always hide if need be

I loved this class and thought that Professor Schildkraut did a fantastic job Even though it was a relatively large class it felt like she really cared about each and everyone one of us and our learning The tests were incredibly fair and she provided study guides for both of them I would love to take another class with her 
Shes a fantastic professor deeply engaged with her topic and works to bring her students to that same level of interest Though its not an easy class it is highly recommended if you are at all interested in political science and psychology as the class is a perfect combination of the two 
Inconsistent with grading not at all clear in explaining mathematical concepts Possibly a great teacher for other subjects but generally unhelpful in this area 
Excellent Professor Lectures in an incredibly clear and concise manner If you show up to class you realistically just need to review as opposed to read everything Gives study guides for her tests One of the best professors Ive had at Tufts 
Classes were not too interesting all powerpointshe seemed really uncomfortable speaking in front of a crowd which always made me feel uncomfortable She was very condescending and was not helpful at all when I needed an extension on a  page paper because my senior astrophysics thesis was due 
This class has taught me tangible skills that I can use in a future career which was awesome Prof S has clear lectures Dont be afraid to go to office hours shes very helpful Sometimes you cant tell if she likes you or not but more often than not she likes you Overall tough class but great class

Great professor who is extremely organized and passionate about the material She made an intro to american politics extremely interesting and helped me realize why I want to be a political science major The class requires a good amount of work but if you do the reading you should be fine 
Where to even begin I came to Tufts to take courses like Schildkrauts Political Psychology She is clear reasonable likeable knowledgeable and masterfully structured this course I cannot say enough positive things about her or PS in  characters so just take my advice take this class 
Schildkraut was an awesome teacher definitely the best one I had this semester She knows a ton about poli sci and has written a lot of stuff in the field too Brian Conley was an awesome TA too I would definitely recommend this class its not too hard either 
Professor Schildkraut is hands down the single best professor I have had at Tufts University A hard class is made doable by her organization and clarity in lecture If only there were more professors like her 
Prof Schildkraut will take the time to help you if you go to see her unlike some other profs PS  is a big class but a friend had her in a small one and said she was great I like her presentation style and I think she grades fair 
Nice enthusiastic clear She tries hard to make an attimes painfully basic class interesting and mostly succeeds I wasnt too thrilled with my TAs but she is an excellent professor

Schildkraut is an amazing professor Her lectures are engaging and she is incredibly accessible outside of class If you are interested in American Politics you should definitely take a class with her The papers are long and difficult but it feels good to finish them Her exams are completely based on the study guides so it is easy to do well 
she is very detached from the class makes her TAs do everything lots of unnecessary terrible readings but some were good and worthwhile if you pay attention during lectures and skip the readings in the main text and most of the others too you still should be okay really likes people who speak 
Professor Schildkraut is one of the worst professors at Tufts and in the Political Science Department She is an amateur at teaching and relies heavily on mindless powerpoint presentations and rambling about definitions from the textbook Basically professor Schildkrauts lecures rehash on what the texts already state She is an unfair grader 
Great teacher Attendance wasnt mandatory but I went to most of the lecture because they are extremely clear and straightfoward Shes very passionate about Political Science and a great teacher overall I highly recommend her The recitations were my least favorite things 
Great teacher great classes 
Tests were difficult but she made the classes more fun I felt I had a better grasp of Russian with her teaching compared to Nancy 
Great professor Genuinely interested in the language but most importantly in her students Russian is a tough language but she makes it enjoyable Knows how to joke around but also how to prepare her students as well

Horrible professor very unclear and ppts are really bad and horrible for studying So boring And when asked questions doesnt really know what she is talking about Said that peptide bonds and phosphodiester bonds were the same before correcting herself after the TA pointed out that that was wrong Papers take a long time to get back 
Professor does not explain concepts well especially to those who do not have a background in biology Powerpoints and lectures are not helpful and grading seems subjective 
Human Development and Reproduction  really havent enjoyed this class Professor is very disorganized and the powerpoints dont help at all Studying for the tests is difficult When people did poorly she gave the opportunity to get back points so youll be fine just very frustrated Dont like her teaching style at all 
Enthusiastic warm lecturer Cares about students and comprehension Tests are conventional essaystyle with comprehensive questions covering major lecture topics class notes No tricks or trivia but heavy on memorizing detailed mechanisms 
Developmental Bio Bio Her power points and lectures are hard to follow you end up teaching yourself out of the textbook But she is enthusiastic about the subject and very willing to help in office hours Its a frustrating course bc of the sheer volume of information and lack of grades  tests and a final but is incredibly interesting 
Developmental Biology This professor teaches clearly is understanding about the problems of her students and cares about them She shows extreme trust on her students Her exams are easy because the questions have been really well explained and answered in class 
Very disorganized power points werent helpful one page papers took weeks to get back a disappointing class and teaching style 
Lectures are fine but her questions on exams and projects are crazy She thinks that a B is a top grade and isnt willing to work with students Other than that shes a nice person 
Excellent professor her computational bio class is very interesting and she really knows her stuff and enjoys teaching it Recommended 
Very willing to help me in labs and office hours Explained concepts very clearly in class and in person A good teacher 
Prof Slonim is my fave Was clueless so I made an appt The way Slonim explained made everything so clear and exciting I wish I could take another course with her But too late Im graduating this year Take her course asa you can Shes really the best 
She managed herself quite well despite teaching in Hescotts shadow Very clear explanation of concepts that makes the text largely unnecessary Recommended 
Also the worst professor I have ever had at Tufts Our final group project is worth  of our grade and she is just introducing us to material we must include on it only two weeks before it is due She is unsympathetic to pretty much every problem I have had in her class Also she has no idea who anyone in the class is 
Decent teacher The material taught could be a little bit more focused but otherwise fine We didnt use the textbook at all so Id not encourage buying it I thought this class was hard at times because there is often little instruction surrounding presentations you have to do a lot of the stuff yourself 
Ridic easy at one point said you all have As yeah shes a bad professor but if you want an easy A and some interesting projects not a bad class to take 
Shes fine I guess but the material is really superficial and she doesnt do much to make it interesting Easy grading though 
GROUP PROJECTS 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
Truly does not care for her students She assigns lots of group projects and is not forgiving of mistakes While she does not even try to get to know students on a personal level you better not miss a class as she will reflect this in your final grade 
The worst professor I have ever had at Tufts She literally said I have no sympathy for you when someone had an issue with an assignment She does not explain expectations  months into the semester and we have not gotten a single grade Participation is supposed to be  of our grade but she doesnt even know our names there are  students 
Overall solid professor Charismatic powerpoint outlines are systematic and helpful Unfortunate side effect of large PoliSci class though is same  students asking questions Readings are great youll learn a boatload Bonuswatch how she incorporates her scarf into lectures 
Really great teacher This is a difficult class gradewise but if you put in the work youll be okay 
Greenhill is an excellent and approachable professor She is very wellversed in the material and it shows in her lectures If you put the effort in meaning do the readings and study for the midterms you will learn a lot Considering this is the typical introlevel weed out class she is a very fair grader Recommended with enthusiasm 
Shes well versed but an extremely hard grader She doesnt really go over readings and many of the overlap the same ideas making it hard to ID readers on tests She teaches interesting material though but I would only recommend as a passfail course 
Greenhill is really lively and a fair nice professor but personally it was hard to stay awake in class when the whole lecture was taught from the slides I found it difficult to keep motivated and focused when I was trying to read the slides while she was explaining them at the same time Good person but an eh teacher 
Im a politics geek so I couldnt help but like Intro to IR However I wasnt at all impressed with Greenhill Although smart and well versed she reads straight from the slides which makes her lectures boring
