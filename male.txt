Professor Margalit has been the most fun and likely the best professor Ive had at Tufts He is incredibly energetic and fun genuinely cares about his students and makes sure to learn everyones name in his class In office hours he is the best Textbook not necessary at the time I took the class all homework was online 
Margalit is AMAZING Hes the funniest teacher Ive ever had and makes the material extremely easy to understand even for a Calculus retard like myself The workload is the same as all the other Math  classes but Margalit is always willing to help with HW during office hours and the next class If youre taking Math  take it with him

My favorite class this semester If you are looking for tradition stiff college writing the way I was you will not get it You do about six narrative pieces throughout the semester plus a research paper Its not overwhelming theres a lot of time and feedback steps He likes to pull our leg with quizzes but they arent counted You do learn

He was a great professor I loved the discussions we had about the readings There was reading every week but it was definitely manageable The class consisted of six papers narratives arguments etc and one research paper My favorite part of the class was when we had to present the readings to the class by leading an activity 
Hes such a great guy and is very funny He is also a very lenient grader and a lot of the other English  professors are not He lets you use your voice when you write which I loved and hes extremely helpful Loved him and his class 
My writing did not improve which was the whole point of the class The paper topics were mostly narratives which is not what college writing is about We had to write according to his formula which seemed very juvenile to me If you write a paper about a unique topic be prepared to handle his unnecessary confusion 
Dale is a great guy Dont let his discontent demeanor fool you He bought us doughnuts and coffee one time out of his own pocket What a guy His late policy is sweet too and hes generally easy especially on engineers trying to write 
Dont take his am class Hes an ok guy very boring VERY meticulous essays need to be incredibly clear and bythebook structured for him to understand really not TOO bad but difficult at  in the morning and i personally disagreed with his ideal writing standards it might also be that english  is a really dumb dry unexciting course

The class was comprised of eight papers narratives persuasive pieces a howto creative analogy etc each with specifications He is very clear about due dates for the draft and final copy Each essay is peer edited and you are expected to read one of your eight to the class There is also a project that requires  or  people to lead class 
dramatic with quite the monotone voice Dale is so entertaining Writing really improves He has simple but very helpful comments Highly recommended Allows late papers always

Extremely informative and funny teacher interesting and overall awesome class However an abnormal amount of homework especially for a music class long readings and writing papers 
Awesome professor I took music technology and the digital culture with him Class focused on the philosophy of technology more than expected but was very interesting Auner is very knowledgeable about the subject and always shows a deep passion for what he is teaching Great guy to talk to makes for a solid class 
Prof Auner is a really great guy Loves teaching and is super knowledgeable and passionate about the material There is a lot of reading but most of it is interesting and you will get good grades if you try and care about your work Even for me who hates writing the papers werent nearly as torturous as most and the topics were very intereting

Auner is a great professor He really knows what hes talking about and presents the material clearly He also casually makes hilarious comments if you pay attention Definitely would recommend the class if youre interested in music history 
Professor Auner is very knowledgeable and very entertaining I would highly recommend taking anything with him

he is a smart guy but is a very hard grader you have to work extra hard to pass his classes 
This class Human Sexual Behavior is a lot harder than I originally thought it would be DeBold is funny and easy to understand He uses powerpoint presentations for every class and he puts them on blackboard so its ok if you miss a few classes Exams are MC but HARD There is an optional final that you can use to raise your grade 
Debold is a bold professor He is funny laughable and very attractive His method is like the penal system It relies on justice transparency and a hard wooden object

human sexual behavior great class very interesting covers subjects in a lot of different areas not just psych textbook was good debold is a great teacher really interesting clear and down to earth tests werent easy as pie but they were very fair if you come to class and study a little youll be fine 
PSY  and  Really memorable Tests really arent that difficult as long as you keep up with the lectures and do the readings There are three tests with  multiple choice questions per test and an optional final The final can be used to boost your grade it can replace  of your test average so the class really isnt that hard

I thought he was very condescending during class Tests were hard pop quizzes were unmerited Going to office hours didnt help 
One of the nicest people in the Psych department hands down His lectures are relatively clear and thorough 
Your final grade is based on  multiple choice exams and an optional final Dont be fooled the exams are HARD The material is complicated and lots is covered over the semester His lectures are very clear but he has a boring personality 
   Really great professor He cares about students learning and understanding and always tries to make the lectures as interesting as possible with movies and clips in his power points Exams are multiple choice for physio and human sexuality but dont be fooledthey are very difficultyou need to study A LOT Great classes great professor 
Human Sexual Behavior  This is not as easy as it seems Most people get away with Bs not too many As and some Cs and lower This is a decent elective for a Psych major because it is pretty entertaining  Multiple choice tests with an optional final that you can use to raise your grade You have to do the work but it is manageable 
he wont hold your hand while you learn but youll definitely learn 
good lecturer at ease but organized and clear this classs grade is based on solely on multiple choice tests very prompt grading

Jordan is the man Simply a lovely human being in every facet of the truth He cares about his students and does a fantastic job of making everyone feel like an equal member of the classroom regardless of religious belief or prior knowledge His classes leave you thinking about things you never believed you would be This man deserves a statue 
american society sounded like an interesting class but ended up being a watse of time ennis was mainly in his own world during lectures and the class was normally dull 
This class uses a confusing CDRom based application that replaces a textbook making it hard to understand how to apply models The prof is a waste of time in class and only serves to further confuse The tests are nothing like what is taught 
Really excited about statistics despite the dryness of the subject Difficult grader but fair Many take this class just to fill the math requirement and then complain when its not AMAZINGbut one gets what one deserves Learned a lot Good class overal 
I really enjoyed Ennis Survey of Social TheoryAlot of fantastic books by great writers Some see his lectures as disorganized but I just look at it as his own style of teachinghe has a way of dancing around big points for a few classes in a row and at a certain point you begin to see the big picture and when you do you really understand it 
He has little interest in his students He does not truly care if you understand the subject and makes no effort to clarify if asked Perhaps the department needs to reevaluate its professors 
Class sounded great ended up not being so interesting 
This class is a good math for nonmath people Not exactly an easy A the exams are not super easy but the class is simple I found the material not to interesting but I learned stuff and tools that were useful for all my other classes and especially for social sciences I hated the program at first but got used to it and it is useful 
American Society decent class lectures totally pointless you learn NOTHING I mean NOTHING in class just looking crap up on the GSS website and writing memos Ennis is fairly nice and helpful though the course is OK 
I got a lot out of American Society because of the readings Ennis is not great at managing class time but he does assign REALLY good readings Like a lot of soc classes you have to put in effort to get something out of it but thats not a bad thing Im so glad I took this class because I worked to make it meaningful and it was 
His slides are boring and he loves to talk about charts and graphs The class time is not well managed and he is not engaging He assigns lots of readings and expects you to remember all of the authors names He assigns a major research paper at the end of the course and his not very helpful when you go and ask him questions 
His voice is very soothing and sometimes puts you into a trance I was really excited to take the class but that soon changed when class started It was boring dry and there was lots of reading that was not interesting He is a nice guy but the class and the way he went about it is boring Would not recommend it 
An easy way to get rid of a math requirement Ennis can be a little boring but cares so much is so nice very fair and very accessible 
This is by far the worst professor Ive had at  years at Tufts His presentation is completely incomprehensible even though I have a background in the subject He is also incredibly rude when you ask for any help I have never met a professor less concerned with students than this one 
Ennis is an awful professor Cannot teachexplain basic concepts Isnt very helpful Tests dont reflect what he taught in lectures Powerpoint slides are useless Very very very unhappy with this class 
Its a shame Ennis gets such a bad rep on here Hes not the most exciting lecturer to a large group his forte is smaller classes hes great at trying to encourage participation and if you engage with one of his interests hes great He does genuinely care about students progress and hes one of the most unbelievably intelligent profs at Tufts 
Not sure what all the negativity is about Ennis was a great teacher Good presentation skills very accessible  approachable after hours thoughtful insight on material  assignments understanding of students needs Id take any of his courses 
Ennis is the worst professor I have had at Tufts in terms of clarity helpfulness and respect for students This class uses a  yr old program only because Ennis is buddies with its creator I went to him repeatedly for help and his answer every time was that there was nothing I could do to better study He talks AT you he doesnt teach you 
this site does not do too much justice to Professor Ennis I found him to be exceedingly intelligent  maybe so much so that he does sometimes get into his own world Lectures are sometimes dull reflected in the generally low class participation but he really knows everything there is about sociology Fair grader 
Very nice Helpful and easy to get along with 
Unclear as to what he is looking for in assignments work the Final grade is almost entirely based on a business plan that the class has to decide on whether they like or not It doesnt really matter whether you do the work according to the book he is the decider Very strange grading system class is ok 
great teacher loved the class two quizzes that are a bit hard if you do not do all of the reading short response papers for homework fun class 
Very easy class and pretty interesting Half the grade is based on a final business plan that takes a lot of work He gives lots of opportunity for extra credit and wants everyone to understand the material and do well 
Whatever people say about the ivory tower about narcissistic professors only caring about their careers does not apply to the great Eric Rosenberg This professor knows everything about his subject He has incredible generosity of spirit Hes a great wit Because of him Im not going to Law School but will start my doctorate in art history 
Verbose Loves dependent clauses 
FAH is a great class a nice overview of later art Rosenberg is registered as the prof but there are guest lecturers from the department for each topic I didnt love Rosenbergs style as much but he is lecturing less than half the time A goofy guy just not as clear as some other FAH profs Great great class use your TAs for help too 
Wow What can I say Basically my mom told me I should take art history I had no interest But then when Professor Rosenberg showed up I realized that there ARE cool intellectuals who are also hilarious humane and can make fun of the world while making us understand it This guy can tell you about Wittgenstein Winslow Homer and Curly Howard

Awesome guy totally available and so freakin nice My highest recommendation 
Professor Umarov is a great guy Great professor very clear and very approachable He really likes his students and wants them to do well Helpful during office hours if you need some extra explanations I highly recommend him 
The professor Umarov is very helpful especially when u go to his office and u have questions he is actually trying very hard to answwer all the question i have Additionally I love the slides of his presentation which makes the topic very easy to understand I disagree with all people who dropped the class because he is very good teacher  smart 
During the course of the semester Professor Umarov demonstrated that he not only knew how to teach the material successfully but could keep it light hearted and entertaining He showed a genuine concern for the progress of his students and although he sometimes missed the point of a question he was always gracious and knew what he was doing 
Professor Umarov was incredibly kind and helpful over the course of the semester I sought help from him on numerous ocassions including times that were not his stated office hours and he always took the time to meet with me and review the material for the course He is very dedicated to his students 
Loves the material tries hard Some of his lectures are clear and helpful but many of them are confusing He often gets confused and makes mistakes His accent while highly amusing does not help with his clarity

The class is meant to be realworld which makes it hard Braun tries to make us figure things out which can be confusing but it helped me prepare for my summer internship so much I would definitely recommend this class and professor 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
GROUP PROJECTS 
Professor Braun has good intentions but the course is so poorly organized that its almost impossible to know what is due when and what is expected for the assignments Though he grades very easily the way he teaches is obviously driving all of us nuts He also makes you use a site called hands instead of trunk and it almost never works 
GROUP PROJECTS 
Prof Braun proved to be a real disappointment as a teacher He was unwilling to give students a clear explanation for his grading His instructions were always extremely vague but he expected the responses to be specific He also forces students to use his app that only works on ipads so many of my classmates were always struggling to rent them out 
I am so confused about whats going on so far in class and that says alot since its the first week of classes Doesnt use trunk instead uses another learning website which is confusing and often doesnt work this adds to the confusion of what assignments we have and when they are due Gives due dates on holidays which is absurd Disorganized 
He doesnt struggle to speak but he struggles to get out words which mean anything An inefficient communicator he has a generally poor attitude towards education takes off points if you dont show  and speaks with a soothingly dull tone Beware 
Physiology The visiting professors were great but Soneks own lectures especially the slides were dull and uninteresting 
He has a hard time controlling his class and keeping interest during lectures but his lecture slides are useful and he is so helpful when meeting outside of class One on one hes great but not so much during lecture 
Sonek is very knowledgable but his lectures are very dry He is very lax about assignment due dates He is also very willing to meet outside of class and even agreed to put on a review session on a saturday 
Joel Rosenberg is a knowledgeable and considerate individual but as a professor he has his downsides namely that he will tolerate almost any discussion meaning how the class goes is up to the class This can be great or highly unfortunate However he will talk to you outside of class and genuinely appreciates and recognizes sincere interest 
Professor Rosenberg is an absolutely brilliant man and has a very refreshing style of teaching His class is entirely discussion based and he has a true desire to see students thrive creatively He is so open minded His wealth of knowledge is awe inspiring He makes students feel at home with the material and free to express themselves 
He is the most helpful professors I have found at Tufts He is dedicated to seeing his students learn and you clearly can see the love he has for teaching and for helping his students grow which I find refreshing when you come across so many prof who just stand up and talk One of my favorite professors Definitely a critical grader 
Prof Rosenberg is just an old man who is looking to share his knowledge and interests with others Wide range of films with course reader and two papers Class format is completely discussion based Overall a great professor 
Prof Roesnberg is extremely knowledgeable and class format is incredibly open However he teaches very little and allows discussion to go wherever it will Dont be surprised when you get a paper back and he rips you apart His comments are often snide and patronizing And this is coming from someone who got an A in the class 
Class was generally too long and bit boring Prof Rosenberg will talk to the class for about  minutes straight at a time and then abruptly switch to class discussion mode resulting in periods of awkward silence Luckily there are only two papers and hes a fairly easy grader and very honest with his comments a good thing A nice guy

This guy had a  coming into the semester and I am extremely unsure of how that happened Turner is definitely a smart guy but when it comes to teaching he is confusing and the material is not engaging i expected to learn more about the macroeconomy in this class The problem sets were also extremely difficult However class is curved 
Tests are a guessing game based on nothing discussed in class 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
On the first exam he wrote a question worth almost  of the grade that said Will the following contribute to GDP Bigger or smaller with no indication of reference for the second question When students asked him what it meant he commented your interpretation of the exam is part of your score

I took Game Theory with Turner and absolutely loved the class one of my favorite courses Full disclosure I knew I liked GT going in but with a lesser teacher this course could have been much less enjoyable Weekly HW feels like a lot but is necessary to keep up with the material Tests can be tricky but hes lenient with the curve Loved him 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
Turns Game Theory into Sleep Theory Homeworks are way harder than what he teaches you during the lectures Boring dull and even he seems perplexed 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
I am extremely disappointed to walk out of this class feeling like I learned nothing about macroeconomics The lectures contain virtually zero math while the psets are exclusively quantitative He once hurried me out of office hours because I was asking specific questions The curve is absurd and a couple points makes or breaks a letter grade 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
Pretends to be accessible to students but if you actually go to office hours hes not helpful Hell answer a different question than the one asked and then refuse to actually answer your question because youre supposed to be learning Graded entirely on Z scores so no matter how well you do all that matters is how you compare to others

Without question an amazing professor Not only is he extremely knowledgeable of financial mathematics but also of current issues in the economy that relate directly to the material His energy makes lectures worthwhile and his willingness to spread knowledge is inspirational Do not hesitate to ask questions as he is always there for students 
Hes not a very clear teacher but if you go to office hours you can easily get perfect scores on your problem sets most people got perfect scores on the tests and he lets you have cheat sheets So though the class may be confusing it is definitely passable if you are willing to view the work and class time as separate 
Turner teaches macroeconomics in a modern way so that you learn so much I really think youd be detracting from your economics education if you took EC with another professor Tests are difficult and problem sets are also hard but he is so accessible in office hours and really wants to help you learn Overall one of my favorite econ profs

Wow best professor Ive had at Tufts easily I think what Professor Turner does best is that he uses simple examples to illustrate a concept which he does in depth and usually builds on previous concepts and then extends to more complicated but quite interesting examples Go to class stay engaged and you will be rewarded 
TOUGH GRADER 
This class is not helpful at all Learnt nothing out of it 
Hes very willing to help you if you want to learn the materialeither go to office hours or ask questions in class Exams are moderately difficult but its a very generous curve A is the average Overall great professor Would definitely take another class with him 
Just awful all around Pretty sure he literally emailed kids who did the best on his first exam to leaving him good ratings

I was prepared for the worst when I took his Game Theory this semester having read all the terrible reviews on this site But his classes are actually pretty interesting if you stay engaged Its definitely not an easyA class but go to his office hours and ask questions Hes patient and caring 
I dont understand how Turners rating is so high Hes honestly not very bright He seems to be figuring out how to do problems as he goes His powerpoints are difficult to follow and you can be almost certain that hell answer your question in a snarky way that wont help

Great Professor clearly cares about his students and goes the extra mile to make himself accessible outside of class 
Great class fantastic teacher Really knows his stuff and the class is always interesting Great for people thinking about careers in business in my opinion Very approachable after class with any questions Eager and excited to talk about topics

David Smyth is a top  professor at Tufts I added this class at the last minute and expected to drop it but it turned out to be my favorite class at Tufts so far His lectures are informative engaging and funny His interest and enthusiasm for Math are infectious Theres a problem set every week and two exams total Super manageable workload 
Out of all the lecturers Ive had in my life he is the best at  giving intuition and big pictures for how and why things are done  giving the audience confidence by pretending to be working at their level  making the audience relaxed for learning crazy things He is world class at teaching and a must take for every Tufts student 
Smyths lectures are clear and he is very obviously passionate about the subject which helps make the class not seem so boring 
HILARIOUS 
CARING 
Prof Smyth is so funny and is a great teacher His lessons were very clear and he makes sure you know the reasoningproofs behind everything He LOVES proofs My favorite part of class though was how real he is he is not one of those snooty professors who knows everything and is constantly trying to prove that to you 
He is a very nice and hard working professor Whenever you need help you can always find him in his office and ask for help His class is easy to follow and always ends up learn a lot of new information 
LECTURE HEAVY 
The way it is taught is absolutely outdated For embedded system programming nobody uses assembly language anymore but it is still what is taught U learn nothing out of it except some grammar of assembly Comp covers all of it and much more dont waste time on this take comp

Prof Chang is super nice and caring While he does write pretty fast his notes are generally very organized He gives weekly quizzes but hes very generous with points EE  is honestly not a hard class especially if youve taken Comp You might be lost at first but if you go to his office hours youll realize its not that difficult 
His lectures are decent nothing super special Chang really cares about his students and if you ask him about helping in internship searches and for recommendations hes more than happy to help 
Professor Chang cares about his students as much as any professor I have ever met He places emphasis on learning and grades very generously He does give a lot of material however especially at the end of the semester As mentioned previously his accent makes him difficult to understand at first but youll get used to it 
TOUGH GRADER 
GET READY TO READ 
after the class you learn nothing about microprocessor architecture or anything applyable  but some useless and old assembly language 
Prof Chang is a god 
Prof Chang is god His notes is logical and crystal clear Very nice person 
Gives you a ton of information to learn writes on the board very fast The accent takes some getting used to but after a couple classes you can understand Just make a good cheat sheet for exams 
His class is ok  I asked him for reference when looking for job he agreed nicely and he gave very bad reference

Extremely engaged and in touch professor Knows the material very well and does a good job explaining if you ask questions Must be an active participant to get the most out of this course 
so brilliant so hot 
Knows his subject incredibly thoroughly Great class His lectures are interesting and he does a good job of getting students involved in the lectures asking questions etc Reading can be heavy but material is gone over in class intensively enough that if you skip a bit of reading its okay 
He was a very clear and straight forward guy that will give help if you need it He expects a lot from students but grades fairly overall good guy 
Grades in an incredibly harsh manner to the degree of absurdity Lessons are generally incoherent and assignments highly unclear Clearly an intelligent person however lacks the ability to teach competently

Professor Evrigenis is amazing Went to every lecture and looked forward to every discussion session He is engaging funny and reveals lessons through discussion like Socrates himself Yes readings are tough but you only need a basic understanding to follow along and do well Would recommend to all PS majors as well as all students 
Meh hes just allright Class isnt anything special just a standard intro level poli sci class with a smart professor who sometimes isnt very clear with regards to what is the take away message Overall not too bad but dont go out of your way to take the class 
TOUGH GRADER 
Intense reading extremely fastpaced lectures harsh grading 
Great professor smart man but challenging class unless you are into all that philosophy stuff Lots of reading first exam are passages from the texts studied so far second exam is a takehome essay Both are fairly challenging but his marks are somewhat generous 
The comment that hes a Greek James Bond basically says it all but not only is he a great dresser but also an excellent teacher Do what you can of the readings but mainly go to discussion based class He knows it all and keeps it interesting and fun 
Evrigenis was one of my favorite professors last semester He is a really helpful lecturer and in my large Western Pol Thought I class managed to facilitate a lot of class discussion His lectures helped me get a lot more out of the complex philosophies of the readings Also dresses like hes the Greek James Bond which he might as well be 
Totally unassuming mild mannered guy but secretly very intense and thoughtful I took his Western Thought I class It was like taking a class with Socrates himself He had a great way of leading students to conclusions without telling us what to think Highly recommended 
Evrigenis first of all definitely knows the material like the back of his hand The man is brilliant The most important part though is that he cares about his students understanding You will learn so much in this class and if you dont understand ASK A QUESTION Evrigenis whole method is making you think by making you ask questions

Excellent professor Dry witty and downright hilarious but also one of the most intelligent people you will ever meet in your life Fair grader too as long as you do the readings and participate you will be fine 
Evrigenis is simply put an amazing professor Knows his material very well he engages his students and throughly explains any and all doubts the students might have about the extensive reading 
Best professor at Tufts Probably one of the most intelligent people you will ever meet Always gives crystal clear lectures even though topics are often difficult to comprehend 
The guy knows the books hes teaching inside and out and his lectures are always extremely well organized and easy to follow He tries to encourage class involvement but he can be intimidating as he expects you to be able to answer correctly all the time Good class though 
Excellent Evrigenis is more or less an authority on half the texts we read in the class and it shows Good lecturer very well organized but not the best at encouraging class involvement his Socratic method is a little intimidating Hes more than willing to discuss and explain anything if you bother to seek him out though Lots of reading 
Definitely one of the best professors Ive had at Tufts possibly ever After a few weeks of his class I decided to major in PS because of it Hes a very intelligent and inspiring teacher yet still approachable friendly and wants to help you understand Highest recommendations 
Knows it all backwards and exudes that Can be captivating but not necessarily always crystal clear Definitely not an easy course 
Hes one of the best teachers I have ever had Not only is he very clear he also has a great sense of humor and is very friendly I never felt intimidated to speak in class He was genuinely concerned about your understanding of the material and he made the whole class enthusiastic to learn I would take another class with him in a heartbeat 
expected a lot from this class he is very closeminded and dismissive and refuses to engage in any debate Also absolutely no standard when it comes to grading system So annoying that CBS majors have to take this idiotic class

He was in navy and definitely the best computer scientist among his comradeinarms The lecture is crystal clear and the assignment is considerably easyas he provided you IO and other stuff you only need to implement the data structure The only flaw is that he is not good at debugging But a good lecturer is all what you want 
I havent finished the class yet but so far hes been a struggle He messes up a lot during lecture I can forgive him a bit since this is his first semester here and hes a great person but so far hes been an ok at best professor

He is a really nice and charismatic guy He is clear during lectures and happily takes questions although sometimes seems like he just reads from Wikipedia not much depth He gets the material across clearly sometimes shows up at labs is always available after class to talk and cares that every person does well Funny too in a quirky way

I LOVE PROF WOODIN Had him for epi and biostats biostats was definitely a lot harder His TA is an incredibly tough grader but he kind of makes up for it He is a great guy and really cares 
Material is pretty dry but Woodin is really funny and smart and classes are interesting because of him Course is pretty easy if you go to class but beware he SWEARS up and down on the first day that hes really good about emails and responds within a day but he NEVER responds to emails Dont count on him for that Otherwise great prof 
Such a great sense of humor Super willing to help 
Woodin is a great teacher The subject could be really boring but he keeps the class interesting He really seems to care about the students and is very helpful Hes quite funny Everything is group projects  even the final Great guy 
Great examples made hard subject matter very interesting 
woodin is great he has really dry humor which will keep you engaged group projects are fun and make the class pretty easy  but also makes learning fun 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
TOUGH GRADER 
GROUP PROJECTS 
the worst class Ive taken at Tufts Hes also problematic sometimes He doesnt know how to stay on topic 
This class was incredibly boring Professor Woodin while a very nice man tends to go on tangents and take far longer to explain things than need be He explains the material clearly yet is not very succinct and has a tendency to ramble I will note that I am not a major in the department so perhapse the material just did not appeal to me 
he is awesome and so clear easy a 
I found him extremely irritating Tries really hard to be cool thinks hes smart and students arent White dude from new england who doesnt know how NOT to be offensive when talking about women people of color and working class people glad its over 
Woodin is a funny guy and does a good job covering a boring topic He does tend to go on weird tangents for just a bit too long and go on about a fairly simple topic for longer than necessary but I think part of that is that the amount of material the course covers allows him to do that In any case I did well in the class without much work 
Professor Woodin was great I have no idea what the rest of these people are talking about If anything hes on the opposite end of the spectrum from biggoted Class was interesting hes funny in a sort of nerdy professor way 
As said before Woodin enlivens a fairly dry topic with his stories and thank the Lord In terms of his humor it is quite sarcastic and he is EXTREMELY frank via email or in person it just takes some getting used to Overall a good guy and a valuable asset to the department 
I loved this class All the work is done in groups which takes alot of pressure off His lectures are always entertaining and he really makes otherwise boring material really interesting 
I took his class about  yrs ago and I still remember him This is a lively funand very useful class Epi is not a very interesting subject but Prof Woodin brought it to life for our class Great Professor I will never forget him God bless you prof Woodin I am a person of color and did not find anything he said offensive 
INSPIRATIONAL

Woodin is so great I took biostats with him and its super manageable Hes very good about going over concepts that people arent clear on and hes very clear in his explanations Makes biostats fun Also very funny 
This class is laughably easy You will get an A if you literally turn in your work Most of his answers to questions dont make much sense and his powerpoints are quite uninformative Nice guy you will learn a lot about topics unrelated to epi You wont learn much about epi though 
Made a difficult subject very entertaining in an educational way 
The pm Thursday night lecture is not the easiest to sit through but overall this class isnt too hard It was a little bit slow for my taste we barely covered half of what was on the syllabus But Woodin is funny and caring and tells lots of stories that help pass the time 
What an unprofessional professor This guy should be a  standup comedian not a professor Oh and did I mention he got his PhD from Harvard Yeah he thinks thats pretty hot but it got pretty old after hearing it for the millionth time

Rusty is a great guy and a very knowledgeable professor This course is an excellent intro to environmental policy issues and Rusty organizes it very well He is unbiased and professional dont expect an eccentric environmentalist Lots of relevant and interesting information  take it if you might be interested in environmental issues at all 
Rusty is concise smart as hell and excessively verbose Hell tear you a new one if youre not on your game but hes a great guy and great professor 
He knows what he is talking about The trick is to figure out what he is talking about without letting him know that you dont know since it obviously pains him to realize we dont understand these simple thingsHe has LITTLE TIME

Great guy wants to help his students a lot However sometimes his explanations are a bit unclear 
Really cool class on EU economics He is very passionate about the class which is awesome Really helpful in office hours He is not that easy though but you will learn a lot 
Hyatt encourages students to discuss and formulate their own responses to the material while introducing key ideas periodically to push the analysis further The loose structure seems appropriate for the seminar setting Interesting enjoyable class 
The Talloires course he didnt bring up the readings in class so why should we have done them The discussions floated all over the place full of generalizations and imprecise statements that he did nothing to control He is better as a scholar or academic he spoke much more clearly about his work than when he guided discussions 
It was a great class for Talloires but he really didnt engage the reading material It might have been because we had a seminar with a range of disciplines and backgrounds but there was a lot of potential for in depth discussion and he let the conversations run themselves A very nice man overall and interesting material for the course 
tests were not bad if you read the book and attended class especially for guest lectures the essays however were tricky he had a very specific idea as to what he wanted our essays to be but had trouble getting that through to students so that was unclear and i cant say that anyone was too happy with his grading system either for papers 
This is a discussion class  yet hes terrible at clarifying where his discussion wants to go He asks questions that even if you DO the reading have no direction and no clear answers Very confusing and unclear

Professor Izsak was the best This was his first time teaching ED and he was a fantastic teacher in my opinion While the material we read throughout the semester was challenging it truly opened my mind on a lot of topics Lots of thoughtful group discussions and time spent discussing confusing hw concepts Highly recommend him as a professor 
The most fun teacher Ive had so far Lectures are actually enjoyable to listen to 
Best prof at tufts hands down 
He is very charismatic and full of energy However I felt that his lectures were not that clear and were quite repetitive 
Talk about overrated from the getgo He should confine his duties to administration Gets lost in his own thoughts and ruminations doesnt get near to completing syllabus testing is peculiar and one of the more selfimportant profs on the Hill 
So good So good 
Certainly an entertaining and enthusiastic professor Unfortunately its difficult to take much of the class seriously as little serious work is involved Tests are fairly easy but dont provide much of an intellectual challenge 
Class was hilarious Didnt really make a difference if you went to class or not the  tests were take home and really easy Great guy who really makes an effort to get to know his students even if it is a big class

Such a great prof His lectures were always entertaining and always interesting Intro to Yiddish Culture is an easy A with very little work involved Great literature and lectures 
Hes probably the best professor Tufts has got along with probably the funniest class Hes a great guy in and out of the class room and makes you enjoy whatever topics at hand Take his class before you graduate

Storeygard is by far the worst teacher as well as Econ professor I have ever had in my life His slides are not only terribly unclear but he confuses himself frequently in the middle of explanations Coupled with terrible teaching he is a harsh grader who gives little explanation and no extra credit If you dare take his class do not expect As 
Hes very easily confused prefaces most of his sentences with I think and is about the most boring lecturer on the face of the earth but if you can stay awake he actually presents the material in a manner that I found very clear and easy to understand He doesnt give much in the way of practice material but problem sets and exams are easy 
Very nice guy but the material is pretty challenging More quantitative stuff Problem sets are a huge part Not too good at explaining things but maybe its his first year teaching

The content of the class is incredibly fascinating I loved learning about the different methods to measure development and how different countries organizations have approached the problem of underdevelopment His Tests are very hard and specific I personally did not like them He doesnt provide good feedback and is unclear 
Obviously a very smart guy but often mixes up variables and has confusing explanations in class A lot of work outside of class is required to do well

Adam made English  a hundred times more tolerable than I thought it would be Hes super kind and patient not to mention hilarious Go to his office hours in Tower Hes super helpful and works really hard to set you up to write well during college 
Easily the most interesting class offered at Tufts take it if you have any interest in the subject matter at all 
sure the guy is a genius but prepare to endure endless name dropping and personal anecdotes about other philosophers dont expect too much in the way of explanation or actual teaching his attitude seems to be if you dont get it right away you shouldnt be there smart people can be so dumb 
Took a small freshmanonly seminar class with him last semester Incredibly passionate loves debate wants to see you learn but isnt patronising Class time was very casual but I still learned more than in the rest of my classes put together

Took this class as a nonbio major While I enjoyed the material the questions on the exams can be really random This course is definitely not an easy A but you can come away with a solid B if you put in the effort Ellmore is hilarious and it is an experience to be in a class with him 
Ellmore is the man Hilarious He makes plants awesome I loved this class and I want to take every class he teaches No textbook  just go to class and take notes The exams are straightforward if you go to every class As a person he loves to do his own thing and not be bothered but hell gladly talk to you if you want to talk about plants 
i took this class in talloires if you are good at memorizing its great  if not youll struggle a little interesting to learn about flowers when youre in their natural habitat interesting teaching style funny professor blunt to his students and respects it when you are blunt back knows EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know abt plants 
I had Ellmore over ten years ago and he is one of the only teachers I remember from Tufts I now teach Biology myself and when I teach plants I say to my kids what he once said in his plant phys class  quotPlants do everything we doonly much much s

Professor Ellmore is a really entertaining lecturer I feel like I learned a lot BUT the tests are absolute bull You can study as hard as you want and still not be prepared for the weird curve ball questions If you want to learn about plants this class is a great fit If you want an easy A science credit drop it ASAP 
George Ellmore is a great guyCharismatic and funny he definitely keeps the lectures entertaining I would beware however of thinking the class is easy because it is designed for nonscience majors There is no text book so all the information must come from personal notes Tests are difficult and you must be very meticulous about note taking 
everyone says he shags the students 
who cares if he is hot he is an ass and often too sarcastic 
hysterical guy the lectures are interesting enough to wake you up in the morning tends to go off on tangents but theyre well worth the distraction the one problem is that the tests are graded really hard and you have to take incredibly detailed notes to do well on them since theres no book recommend a tape recorder and attending every class 
He is so passionate about plants But his lectures were very straightforward His enthusiasm is definitely worth taking the class for though 
i thought he was by far the best lecturer in Bio  He made me want to stay awake in class and actually come He is very interesting and i actually learned stuff about plants instead of cramming it and then forgeting it all I liked him a lot 
Ellmore is an interesting guy Hes very enthusiastic about teaching and is pretty funny on top of that However he doesnt really stick to his powerpoints goes off on tangents and rarely ever finishes lectures so make sure you go to class 
I LOVE HIMif he werent so old id propose o 
Kept his lectures entertaining and relevant in a subject that could be really boring Tests werent badbut you have to study Really funny allaround nice guy 
Ellmore is hilarious Hell go on long tangents but he always comes back around to the material His tests are super easy  just study the main ideas and youll do fine However if you go to office hours beware he might go on a hour tangent about the magical teas he has in his office

This is just regarding Ellmores teaching in Bio but he was a GREAT professor  especially after Professor Chew not that she wasnt nice her test just kicked peoples asses but most people do really well and hes hilarious and I recommend going to his review sessions because everything becomes even more concrete Easiest part of Bio by far 
his test is the easiest bio test you will ever take at tufts

He is very cool His criticisms on your photos could be a bit harsh but in the end you will know what you are doing 
Roswell is very well established in the photo department at Tufts but I doubt he has been outside more than once or twice in the past decade to make any new pictures He is clearly very knowledgable but his lectures are extremely dry and repetitive During lab times he stays in his office on his computer while the TA does his work 
Such a genius 
Roswell is one of my favorite professors ever He pushes his students without being overbearing and is always open to new ideas 
This guy is ridiculous He is very strange and has a disturbing obsession over photographs of women He is not clear when answering questions and I think he enjoys being cryptic which is useless when youre the student I talked to other students in other photo foundation classes and they seemed to enjoy it much more

Not the best history professor Ive had at Tufts but most certainly not the worst He really cares about his subject and knows how to get a class of kids to care about even the most boring moments of US History Two final assignments due within a week of each other  pg paper   pg takehome was a bit extreme but whatever 
Engaging lecturer good sense of humor you can tell he loves history not afraid to express his political views A lot of writing with essay final Learned a lot 
Ekbladh is a very knowledgable professor His lectures are a little disjointed but the project assignments give you much freereign and are very engaging The bulk of the coursework is based on what youre personally interested in researching and he provides extremely useful feedback Although his lectures are boring hes a great professor

Incredibly pompous Frequently throws around the fact that he is a tenured professor Likes to think that his lectures are super interesting but really they are vague pretentious and not enjoyable after the first few weeks A  page research paper an  page midterm paper a takehome final that is  essays over  days  more

Awesome guy and obviously really into his subject The two papers during the semester and the final were the only assignments due during the course The first was reasonable The second was pretty long Overall a great class and a great prof Just a lot of work at times 
The class itself is interesting and Ekbladh offers a different view of American history However his papers are not properly explained He touches on them briefly and then returns them saying students did not listen to the prompt The comments also are offensive There are better ways to say that students miss the point no matter how vague it is 
TOUGH GRADER 
Unfortunately Professor Ekbladhs lectures were neither structured nor engaging it was as if he had come unprepared My peers and I would often leave class wondering what the point of his lecture was I had high hopes for Ekbladhs Int Development class before the semester started but was let down by his laziness arrogance and disorganization

Incredibly knowledgable professor Has a great passion for the subject The course is extremely writing heavy  page paper and then a  page paper and a take home final due within a week of one another Completely manageable if you work responsibly 
Great professor He is incredibly smart but also really down to earth so discussions are interesting but unpretentious If you have any interest in how issues of race are articulated in literature take a class with Radi 
Hes amazing One of the smartest professors I have ever had Not a ridiculously hard grader if you spend the time and produce quality work Take his class You will not regret it 
Radi is an amazing professor Unbelievably helpful outside of class and going to class everyday was just a blast He does a great lecture with engaging discussions Definitely one of the best professors at Tufts Hes the man 
I took his survey class and loved it Professor Clytus makes the material interesting and encourages his students to engage in thoughtful discussions I really recommend taking a class with him 
Probably the best professor Ive had at Tufts so far Hes very intelligent but downtoearth The class itself was really interesting and didnt feel too much like a survey class The readings are unconventional but mostly everyone enjoyed them Tough but good Participation in discussions is expected and necessary 
This class is a necessity if you want to learn about race in America or about identity politics Radi is wildly intelligent and articulates himself really well He challenges your preconceived notions about race and identity If you like the words ribald conflation or racialization then this class is for you Challenging syllabus Engaging topic 
I took a seminar with him It was fantastic material and really thought provoking discussion If you do the reading well you will be rewarded because he is genuinely interested in the views of the students He can become a true mentor if you decide to get to know him He is not a hard grader We need more profs like him 
I took two AfAm Lit classes with Radi The literature he exposed his students to was different than imagined He is an interesting person with great ideas He is funky cool witty and all around awesome 
Radiclani Clytus is the worse professor I have ever had His survey course leaves no room for creative thinking avoid 
Love him He appreciates when students reach out to him after class and is really interesting to talk to definitely brought a refreshing new perspective to Tufts I will surely take another class with him in the future 
The man is the man Great educator in the class and office hours Very articulate Loves alternative view points more than any he comes up with Loves the word modernity Take a course with Radi

Professor Hersh is great His class made me think in a way I havent in other courses I really didnt like him for the first few classes because he can come off as arrogant but his lectures are fascinating and I came to love his class I looked forward to lectures every week He is really funny and it is definitely worth it to go to office hours 
Incredibly smart provides non party line opinions He will challenge the way you think in a great way Definitely a bit full of himself but in such an open way that its great 
Very nice guy At the beginning his teaching style amazes me than it got boring due to lack of interest Exam quite easy sometime a surprise might cause you some point but everyone does generally well Take ES  with him of you can

James was very caring and understanding He wanted to make sure we succeeded and cared about how well he taught the material 
Concert choir is excellent with Jamie I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to sing 
Great conductor great musician and knows exactly how to make a choir sound professional Got a whole lot of sass and loves his backhanded compliments and bows 
Jamie is absolutely witty and enthusiastic and makes choir one of the highlight of this year 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
When the choir didnt know a whole movement of a song and no soprano sang it he simply ignored the problem and told us we were doing well Im also not sure how we will be graded because the promised juries never happened The least fun choir Ive ever been in 
Jamie runs a tight ship in choir but his class is a blast I improved my singing skills and had a great time

Jamie is very talented and intelligent and plans every rehearsal down to the minute to get the most out of our time He is extremely nice too nice for my tastes I like a director that doesnt sugarcoat criticism but could be great for you He picks really good music although he has a taste for music with silly topics which can get tiring 
Jamie does everything well very efficient guy Ive been in choir for almost two years now and can say that he really puts in a lot of effort

Brett was fine but nothing special in a department with some really excellent teachers He didnt seem like he really cared and sometimes shorted assignments because he didnt want to deal with grading It was a fine easy class but dont take it if you want any kind of a challenge 
Brett is the most helpful teacher you will encounter He is young but at the same time very knowledgeable Hes an active promoter for womens rights and equality A fast lecturer but tests are easy He also caters to his students needs We asked for a paper and a test option and he gave us both Loved him

He doesnt give As because Tufts policy states that if you get an A in English  you dont have to take English  Other than that hes a great guy really laidback Always open to talk after class his comments are helpful for revisions Hes leaving Tufts this semester for Bentley I think Very good at teaching you how to conduct research

Lukes English  class definitely helped me improve my writing quite a bit Hes nice and his feedback on papers has been very helpful for revising but dont sleep on the fact that both my review and the first one used the tough grader tag because he definitely is 
Akmehmet is a good guy His lectures are clear and he is helpful during office hours take advantage of them His tests are pretty fair and grading is fair It is Ec so it can be boring but he adds some excitement to it Theres way less math than the other sections 
The class is easy problem sets are easy you just have to stop by class sometimes to understand the material He is helpful if you go to his office hours other than that he is not in the campus 
He is very clear in his lectures which are heavily based on powerpoints that come with the textbook He also spends every other class doing problems on the boards and explain it very thoroughly The problem with his section though is that the midterm and final counts for A LOT and if you screw up on anything there it will seriously hurt 
Great guy really funny The class is interesting and he presents the material pretty well The textbook is complicated as hell though and at a glance you will have no idea what its on about with all its mathematical formulas Thankfully prof akmehmet only uses select information for the course Good class 
The best professor 
Turkish professor with an incredibly enjoyable accent Hes a nice guy and his classes are easy but if youre expecting to learn a lot from an insightful and inspiring professor he is not the one from whom to take a class 
Akmehmet is a pretty solid teacher He explains concepts well and pulls in applications to make it interesting He gives few problem sets so your grade is pretty dependent on the exams That being said he puts a pretty generous curves on his exams which arent too difficult in the first place I would take another course with him 
Akmehmet is a very smart guy and will teach you a lot about econ Hes not available for Office Hours very often but when you go hes very helpful and a really chill dude The exams were completely memorization based Interesting class 
EcDev is known as one of the most engaging courses at Tufts Akmehmet is a Star he makes the students read a lot always informative always humorous

Ozzy is the cutest lil man ever absolutely love him as a person His class is definitely no walk in the park though and his workload will likely be your most demanding class It is very conversationally oriented so you must participate Hes very easy going and willing to give help and extend deadlines The class is overall enjoyable I think 
Very funny Makes class fun tries to get everyone involved He will often introduce some concepts a few weeks before you need to know them  I found this helpful

GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
Wouldnt recommend taking this class with him Even though he is knowledgeable on the subject its hard to understand what hes saying and the content is hard to understand if you dont have prior knowledge on it Had to teach myself the whole syllabus and your whole grade is dependent on  tests without any homework 
If you are looking for an easy and trite overview of monetary economics this class is for you If you are looking for something more serious you will quickly become FED up He favorite class activity is critiquing the oped page though all debate on actually policy seems to be missed on him In short this class has nothing to do with economics 
One of my favorite professors at Tufts He is so nice and very passionate about Micro 
Very enthusiastic about economics but spends class going off on tangents Id say  of class time is spent on actual course material No one goes to class because its easier just to read the textbook However his tests are tricky because he will ask for specific numbers and expect you to know all of the statistics from the readings 
He goes off topic so much in class so you end up having to teach yourself everything His tests are both easy and hard at the same time Hell test you on  chapters and expect you to remember one diagram from one of the chapters and ask you to replicate it as an answer thats  of the test He doesnt really prepare you very well for exams 
Very smart enthusiastic and unbelievably nice 
Goes off topic a lot ended up not finishing the material Even though the exams are straightforward there is a lot to remember in this class and there are a lot of general knowledge questions that could not be located in the textbook 
 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
He only reads off slides so you only really need the slides and past exams to do well on tests However he offers office hours for your questions and gives extra materials to practice You will most likely have to relearn the materials yourself 
so nice 
Terrible teacher Class is easy but tests are not relevant to economics at all 
Professor McHugh is kind of crazy His lectures can be all over the place and he tends to go on tangents a lot For me I didnt think that that was a bad thing and he was pretty entertaining I learned a lot and if you actually go to class its a pretty easy A He tries to teach beyond whats in the textbook and goes into current events as well 
He is an incredibly caring professor who is always willing to help out

A little arrogant and does not make an effort to get to know students His lectures are very esoteric and heavily based on the reading so if you skip the reading or are new to the subject his lectures might be hard to follow Only take his class if you are definitely interested in the subject otherwise its not worth it

Very good and straightforward professor His bark is worse than his bite 
Overall a good class and a great professor he is helpful and readily available outside of class He made the material interesting 
This class was one of the worst decisions of my entire Tufts career The lectures were interesting but were really a chance for the teacher to rant about random topics only about half the class was based on test material A very low percentage of the class attended each classgot good grades Horribe I wish I could take it all back 
He makes everything he talks about interesting and is clear at the same time He really knows what hes talking about The work load is reasonable just as long as you dont wait until the last minute to do everything Very fair and interesting class 
GREAT PROFESSOR One of the most coherent knowledgeable and engaging lecturers Ive ever had Hell make you interested in things you never cared about Workload isnt too bad and he offers extra credit but he does make you work to get an A TAKE THIS CLASS 
Great Professor Very stimulating and knowledgeable Fair grader though requires extra effort to earn the A if you want it Really cool guy get to know him after class And TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM 
Class ranges from mildly interesting to incomprehensible Tends to go off on unrelated tangents Moderately difficult grader Would not recommend taking this class unless you really need a world civart credit 
not especially organized 
very good guy doesnt put pressure on you for small things easy going and fun to be with in class 
loved this man he made me like french again isnt picky about the homeworks but if you want to do well in the class you should do all the homework 
Useless Avoid Too old to still be teaching 
Funny and nice guy Is not an ass about homeworks Tests are easy and class on fridays is fun 
Not interested in you at all always say how easy the material is when its clearly not doesnt help explain just claims how easy it is awful teacher not excited about material isnt flexible about meeting outside of class pick another section 
I really enjoyed having John Julian as a French teacherThough some of his directions werent always clear he was always willing to give extra help if you needed it He was flexible with handing in hw and his quizzes were pretty fair Overall I really liked the class 
Descent and easy teacher Partial immersion method so you dont learn grammar or basics but learn conversational french really fast 
Its bittersweet with Julian Half of you hates him because he plays favorites and will not teach you any practical French esp if youve never had it but then hes such a cute old man that you love him All in all a good guy but a terrible French professor Take only if youve had French before 
I took his Romance Linguistics class For a linguistics professor he forgets to finish sentences forgets accents and misspells foreign words sometimes He is quite old and probably should be retired but its clear that hes still teaching because he loves the subject so much He does know his stuff but he just cant get it out so well

Great teacher passionate about his work willing to help students with classwork and anything else in general He has singlehandedly helped me decide to go to art school for a masters Highly recommended 
Tom is absolutely awesome His class was easily my favorite of the semester I learned a lot about photoshop and also had a great time working on projects and meeting other people in the class He has a great sense of humor and is really laid back  he lets you have a lot of artistic freedom And hes passionate Take this class

Second class Ive had with Rife Lectures are absolutely impossible to understand unclear notes and many mistakes that make understanding the material difficult Didnt follow the notationmethods of the textbook making effective studying nearly impossible Nice professor but learningwise an extremely unsatisfying semester 
Lectures confusing and unclearits his first semester teaching ME However he works very hard in studying the material and puts a lot of effort to help students Great professor but ME is not his specialty Class organization is poor and disjunct but machining lab is very fun Midterms are inconsistent and tricky to study for 
Just ok teacher in class but very kind and willing to spend lots of time in office hours 
Did a great job teaching this course and one of the nicest most helpful teachers around Definitely sounds like major improvement over past courses  controls is his thing Added plus was incorporatingreadingacting out the page from the childrens book midlecture 
A terrible teacher although he is extremely interested in what he is teaching his clarity is seriously lacking He doesnt explain concepts well and expects you to learn them yourself 
Hes no Hescott but hes a great professor nonetheless  
Remco did a fantastic job teaching Comp Class is easy to learn from because he prepares example programs before each class He also gives copies of the code out as handouts so you dont have to spend excessive amounts of time writing everything downjust sit back and listen Try to take this class with him 
He is the professor that will definitely give you great help if you often go to talk with him It feels much more comfortable to take his higher level courses  
Best math professor I have had at tufts by far Incredibly helpful during office hours very thorough in class though he does move pretty quickly Tests arent easy but are across other sections as well and he bumped my grade up when I went to talk to him 
The best math professor at Tufts Always explains everything clearly and is a generally nice downtoearth guy Was very pleasantly surprised since Tufts math professors have a bit of a negative reputation Try to take a class taught by him if you can 
Keith is without exaggeration the best professor Ive ever had at Tufts He explains everything crystal clear and very much encourages students to ask questions or to repeat things At the same time hes very laid back and hilarious Plus every tshirt he ever wears is from threadless or similar He made an awful class much more enjoyable 
Keith Merrill is a god among men Like he is genuinely one of the most helpful teachers at Tufts I suck at math and he was always there to help me and make sure I was grasping the concepts He has office hours like three times a week for two hours ALSO his tshirts SO FUNNY 
Excellent math professor the best Ive had yet He really encourages class participation and asking questions Very helpful during office hours and sincerely cares about his students Sometimes over complicates things but hell go back over it the next class to make it more simple 
Best professor Ive had at Tufts hands down He made pretty hard material seem much more clear and tolerable and he is just a really nice and helpful guy Definitely go to his class everyday and take advantage of his great lectures He has extensive office hours and is really accommodating Take any math class you can with Keith

Prof Merril is one of the clearest professors I have had at Tufts he guides students through the most challenging topic of Calc I with ease and interest He is always willing to explain a topic twice or more if you ask him Only downside his grading method which rewards improvement might penalize those who have a more constant performance 
Genuinely great guy which is an often underappreciated quality about some professors He often overcomplicates problems he does on the board and his quizzes and tests have way harder questions than what he expects you to know on the homework Just try to pay attention and youll get through it with some hard work 
He is a fabulous professor loves grammar and I second all the comments that praise him My only problem with him is that he speaks English way too much It seems like he gets so excited about literature discussion that he forgets he is teaching a French class I have now gone back to just translating everything in my head

Best french teacher ever Knows so much and teaches stuff other teachers wont mention because its not in the textbook Also so nice helpful funny reasonable and wants everyone to succeed 
Pauling is the best french professor at Tufts period He speaks french better than the french ask any french person whos spoken to him and theyll agree and knows more about languages than anyone i know Hes a super clear speaker and his classes are always fun and interesting Never a dull moment If you have a shot at a class dont miss i 
Professor Pauling was great Id heard before the class that he yelled at students and was mean but that was really not the case Hes older Id estimate  so his yelling comes across as grandfatherly Grading was fair on tests but slightly confusing on essays Hes understanding of late work He was very helpful in understanding grammar 
Though energetic and sometimes funny he was rude and insulting There was almost total emphasis on textbook exercises while class was spent going over them I know grammar better but my speaking has not improved and he has made me hate the language after many many years of studying it I did not need him I could have taught myself the material 
Pauling is so intense he makes you terrified in class sometimes However that teaching style was effective for me and I learned a ton in this class He really makes you want to learn French grammar which is something Ive never cared much about Hes great and extremely knowledgeable but can be scary 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS

People either really love or hate Professor Pauling I personally dreaded going to French class every day out of fear of being ridiculed in class for making mistakes He is very loud he is notorious for randomly calling on students and the homework is very arbitrary 
Hes amazing If you want to learn French grammar there is no one else like him And when he gets intense just soak up all of his advice Then laugh at his jokes Youll love class 
Pauling is a great language teacher He really wants you to understand the grammar and concepts of French He is very encouraging and always available outside class Also watch out hes occasionally hilarious 
Before taking his class I was ready to give up on French but he understands that most Americans are not taught grammar so he takes the time to explain in both english and french im much more comfortable and able to speakwrite french now bewareclass is a challenge and he is quite loud and energetic for such a tiny person but you will improve 
Great guy Funny and very enthusiastic you will learn a lot but he is a hard prof 
Pauling is a fantastic professor He really cares about teaching and makes himself available outside class hours if you need extra help Ive never met someone quite as passionate as he is about grammar Theres a constant and reasonable amount of homework He doesnt make it easy but you will learn a lot Definitely take his class if you can

The worst professor Ive had in three years in any subject at Tufts He was disorganized spoke frequently in English tore down my responses and ideas and nitpicked instead of teaching the material I left every class feeling humiliated and discouraged There are so many great french professors here dont waste your time with this one 
Professor Pauling likes to use grammar exercises a lot He can be pretty excitable in class and while for the first week I was really intimidated because he shouted at people I soon came to realize he shouts everything at everyone I think it was less he yells at people for making mistakes but to emphasize how to say things correctly 
Pauling is by far the rudest teacher I have ever had He made students feel inadequate when they tried to answer questions and he was very insulting if a student did not understand something when he felt like they should He swore at a student during office hours when she tried to turn something in late when he had given her an extension 
M Pauling is absolutely insane Sometimes its really fun to take class with a professor who jumps up and down makes funny noises and jokes around but I was too scared to talk much in class because he often screams at people who make grammar mistakes He also made someone in my class cry when she tried to turn something in late 
Hes great 
Prof Pauling loves french and anyone who thinks he is rude or mean is being overly sensitive because he only wants his students to improve and the yelling is funny and makes everyone remember grammar rules tests are SUPER fair and have literally no surprises if you pay attention and do readings Incredibly helpful in office hours def recommend 
Hi is very intense and excited about French Although he could be a little intimidating at first he really encourages his students You will learn a lot in his class and stay interested 
amazing teacher 
Hes very passionate the best French grammar teacher you will ever have Sometimes he seems scary but thats just him getting into it Highly recommended 
Ive taken  classes with Professor Pauling now and enjoyed each immensely He is extraordinarily good at teaching and he brings an enormous amount of energy to the class which rubs off on the students He really does put on a show each period and that makes it worth coming back

he is the best language teacher ever if you really want to learn french he is the perfect person to have as professor

great class Pauling loves what he teaches and explains it well 
Pauling is so enthusiastic it keeps you up even at  AM I learned more in this semester than any other french class and i am much more comfortable speaking conversationally too He is a tough grader on compositions but he is otherwise fair and always willing to help when you ask 
Welloverall he is a nice guy and you learn a lot from his class However he does snap at people and it tends to kind of scare people Nevertheless I learnt quite a bit in his class 
He speaks a good deal of english in a class where english should not be spoken While he brings up many useful grammar points that help with my comprehension of the French written language I dont feel that my spoken French has not changed or perhaps has gotten worse for lack of practice 
Pauling is awesome He is a native English speaker so he really knows how to teach French grammar to Englishspeaking students He was wonderful he knows how to make you learn the stuff He demands class participation and allows plenty of opportunitie 
Great teacher I learned so much from just  semester with Pauling He is extremely enthusiastic about the subject and his excitement will keep students interested and motivated Dont be intimidated by him  he really wants to help you become a better speaker 
Pauling has lots of detailed information but is intimadating as a teacher Yells a lot in class and made me very uncomfortable

An outstanding professor Cares deeply about all his students and wants everyone to succeed 
Pauling was a very clear and precise teacher However I often felt uncomfortable asking questions in class because he would sometimes snap at people Also he practically makes fun of people who answer questions wrong during class activities 
His class was fairly interesting materialwise but got more repetitive as the class went on It seemed like we were learning the same themes over and over Readings every week of varying quality However he is pretty helpful and quite enthusiastic in lectures 
I took HIST  as a freshman  it was way too hard for me Manjapra is very intelligent but also taught this class for students who had a pretty deep understanding of the region not for those who knew nothing There are a lot of readings and they can be hit or miss in terms of how engaging they are 
Hes such a great man His lectures are interesting open to new ideas and not too harsh a grader at all His assignments are really interesting too Take his class 
Really helpful professor makes office hours mandatory the first time because he does genuinely want to get to know his students Material and lectures can get dull at times though

One of the best and most thoughtful professors Ive ever had 
You can tell that he is a brilliant man and that he really cares about what he is teaching He is also really quite caring However I find his lectures hard to follow and rather dry Also the readings are usually hell But on a better note his shirts and socks almost always match That is the highlight of the class 
Wonderful professor Super engaged with the material and very interested in discussions with students Definitely a class where you need to do a chunk of the reading to really get something out of it but absolutely worth it I highly recommend 
Just awesome 
Good professor Difficult subject but class is very organized and clear 
The best teacher He is very friendly and his voice is relaxing He is very kind and explains the material thoroughly He spends alot of time on reviewing the homework contrary to other professors He is also obsessed with Pythagoreo Theorema  
Professor Nitecki is very excited and awed by the beauty of mathematics and really tries to share that with his class Though he can often explain things in a rather confusing way you can always seek clarification via office hours or other means The workload is constant but seldom overwhelming A very good course and prof for math enthusiasts 
Nitecki may be intimidating throughout the course however he is really sweet I chose him as my adviser because although his class may not be the greatest learning experience or easiest although he curves most of the tests but he really does care for his students and their understanding and interest of math 
Professor Nitecki is very enthusiastic and dedicated to teaching students the intricacies of mathematics but is often somewhat absentminded and is slightly unclear during his lessons But overall hes an excellent professor 
hes nice and hes smart HOWEVER i dont know why but he explains things in the most complicated way possible if you go during office hours he tries very hard to help you understand to no avail whatsoever please for your own sake look elsewhere if youre not a mathematical genius 
Very Good 
He knows and likes the math but isnt great at explaining Loves to stand directly in front of what hes just written on the board But he mostly listens to the class and slows down when you ask him to 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES 
This class is designed to be hard It involved Calc    in one semester and is theory based Nitecki is brilliant and passionate but he has trouble conveying the material to students at times He often goes back on himself and can be somewhat insensitive in his comments Grades are  homework so its not too hard to get a good grade

Solid professor though not my first choice Good at simplifying methods into several steps but this makes the class feel very plugandchug Overall reasonable and not disappointed 
hes a pretty bad teacher he doesnt explain new concepts very well and his lectures suck 
horrible i took calc in high school and did really well and all he did was confuse me his lectures were unclear and he usually went way too fast for anyone to absorb the material and copy it all down hes nice but not a good prof 
Ouch 
he really makes you feel disappointed

Amazing professor and very intelligent man You will learn way more than you expect and you will enjoy every moment of it 
Not for the weak of heart or of mathematical abilities He explains things in the most comprehensive and full hence difficult way I was also very uncomfortable with asking him questions he answered them alright but made it pretty obvious that he thought they were stupid 
He made some pretty bad mistakes in lecture and as expected he scared me off from asking questions That being said the course was good because it allowed for student presentations of the material which is unusual for a math course and made for a good introduction to a gradschoollike experience Id take it again 
Horrible teacher I do not know how I would have survived this class had I not taken calculus before He stands in front of the class mumbles into the board and writes MINISCULELY on the chalkboard all the while explaining the material in the most convoluted way possible 
Despite mistakes in class if you look past them to the points he is trying to make lectures are very useful I learned a lot from this class and am excited for diff eq with him It seems like he really cares for his students He has an interesting sense of humor All in all a great professor and a great class 
makes material understandable also friendly 
I thought he was a very poor teacher and made an easy subject complicated 
Professor Nitecki really loves math and tries to convey that love to his students The topics he covers can at times be confusing but his office hours and textbook do a wonderful job of clarifying If you want to solve equations do not take MATH  If you want to really understand math take his class 
He is very interested in Math and his book is really good But he doesnt prepare before his lecture and makes few mistakes everyday The worst is when he starts thinking and reading before presenting the topic which wastes a lot of the lecture time 
A lover of true mathematics Nitecki makes no concessions to aspiring engineers and businessmen suiting the material instead to the needs and abilities of the future mathematicians and theoretical physicists in the class He has great respect and affection for students who grasp and enjoy the material and little sympathy for those who dont

Professor Nitecki is overall a great math teacher His lecture like others have noted can sometimes be confusing However if you take the time to go to his office hours or just stay a few more minutes after class to ask for clarifications Professor Nitecki will explain the same topics unbelievably welltrust me 
worst teacher i have had at tufts made me hate a subject i considered majoring in im sure he is a brilliant mathematician but he is a horrendous professor mumbles proofs to himself as he writes microscopically on the board useless at office hours as he spends an hour explaining things in the most unapproachable way possible avoid if you can 
Great prof Not a huge fan of his  book but he was a wonderful professor and advisor 
Professor Nitecki was a very knowledgable professor who is very dedicated to math His course is difficult but he is willing to help if someone doesnt understand the material Make use of office hours he clarifies the subject a lot more if you seek him out then 
i hate him  stay away from this man

Prof Nitecki really really loves math and you can easily tell that Unfortunately hes not always the best at explaining the concepts so I relied heavily on the textbook for that His class is difficult but if you ask him questions go to office hours or email him he can usually help with any misunderstandings of the material Hard class 
Professor Nitecki is a very enthusiastic teacher a helpful mentor and in general a nice person Although he often made arithmetical mistakes during his lectures the content and delivery of this course was always very precise I am excited to take Differential Equations next semester under his instruction 
He explains things clearly uh sometimes but he seems to take a long time and the correspondence between his lectures and the tests can sometimes be tenuous Im really not sure how helpful he is Just a really odd class Oh yeah He doesnt do a good job of simplifying things He makes you feel confident I guess 
Creeden is really nice and helpfulmuch better than the other Finance prof He presents clearly and he brings cookies Plus hes actually a Venture Capitalist so he knows the subject more thoroughly than a textbook could teach you

The best language professor Ive ever had Extremely approachable helpful and funny Prof Wang makes learning Chinese interesting and entertaining Like someone said earlier I would love to have him as an uncle 
Wang Laoshi is awesome and super super nice Hes always willing to let you take quizzes or pass in homework later and he knows that Intensive Chinese is a tough workload He really wants to see you do well and its not hard at all to get an A bc hes not a hard grader take Intensive 
Wang laoshi is my favorite Chinese teacher Not only is he easy to understand and very clear in his expectations but he is likable friendly and extremely funny His jokes come out of nowhere but are completely hilarious Chinese is hard but he makes it enjoyable I would absolutely recommend him 
He is extremely helpful and nice and really wants you to do well 
Very nice teacher and also very good Very funny and entertaining Makes class fun besides teaching chinese 
Awesome man and makes jokes so strange that you cant help but laugh I probably laugh more in this class than any other Very helpful and understanding full of suggestions and helpful comments Probably the best language teacher Ive ever had 
Hes a great professor who truly cares about his students Understands that sometimes were really busy and helps you out whenever you have questions Also compassions to the fact that Chinese is really difficult and makes allowances accordingly 
One of the best teachers Ive ever had Tufts or elsewhere extremely helpful remarkably clear and has a fantastic sense of humor Can easily rouse a bored and tired class and get people involved

best language teacher ive ever had he has an incredible command of languages and their workings esp english funny guy helpful organized i never dread going to this class an essential contact if you want to pursue paths relating to china great guy nothing but good things to say about him 
Wang laoshi is probably the best professor Ive had at Tufts so far He made you want to come to class everyday and ready to learn new material even if the course was intensive He made class pretty entertaining and is always willing to help you out he wants to see you succeed 
All foreign language teachers should be like Professor Wang He makes learning a language such a joy and is always flexible with the work 
Hes so awesome So nice and so willing to devote time to help you learn Also very understanding about things being late Also very good english and clarity with explaining grammar 
I think the person who commented below was just having a bad day Ben is the best His classes are always interesting and he is very caring about his students He grades the test himself and scales the questions according to how the rest of the class performed Dont take Comp or Comp from anyone else he is worth the wait 
Hands down one of the best AND MOST ENGAGING professors Ive had at Tufts Lectures are never boring we even had class outside one day Ben is always willing to meet oneonone Really really great professor Take his class 
Hescott is extremely fun and intelligent but sometimes he takes making himself clear to EVERYONE so seriously that he spends forever reexplaining concepts that shouldnt take up that much time He takes forever to answer EVERYONES questions and so we move through material extremely clearly and extremely slowly Projects are tough but class was fun 
Love him Best professor and adviser ever 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Honestly wasnt that great He came off thinking he was all that He provided very little online resource Tried to make office hours mandatory which is bull Doing the homeworks were not educational as most of the time spent on them were formatting them to be the way he liked 
No question take this class with Ben if you can Explanations are gold Teaching style is also gold I learned so much and he teaches in a way that you WILL retain the material and not just forget it once class ends Awesome 
One of the best professors at Tufts He is very enthusiastic and his lectures are well prepared Hes one of the reasons Im a Comp Sci major 
He does not like me Pretty much ruined any potential to learn anything from him Other than that I liked his class and I thought it was welldone 
This man is the greatest professor I have ever had and quite possibly the greatest professor in the history of teaching and that is a scientific fact 
Theres a reason why Professor Hescott is a professor that everyone likes Not only does he help his students to become extremely fluent in C but he has a great sense of humor hes really accessible he knows how to navigate the computer science department and he really cares about his students 
Wonderful professor Teaches C like it was an epic tale of adventure Cares about all his students he grades each test on his own over a hundred students Very accessible a quick visit freshman year ended up being a summer research post Dont hesitate to approach him 
I love Ben Hescott His Comp  is easy and funhe explains the concepts with useful analogies and is always willing to go out of his way to help you understand Comp  was the kind of class I never wanted to skip even if I knew the material already Ben is funny casual and creative Definitely take his class 
No question the best class Ive taken at Tufts 
Nothing I can say that hasnt already been said Hes a phenomenal lecturer If youre taking Comp  or  with him dont bother buying the textbook  youll never use it

Awesome Professor 
Ben Hescott is absolutely amazing  he goes out of his way to make material interesting and help students understand concepts Hes also hilarious Hands down the best professor Ive ever had you absolutely MUST take a class with him 
Great teacher in every way Class is fun and extremely useful I never programmed before and went through the semester without cracking open the book didnt even own it and still got an A Thats more an indication of how useful his lectures are than how easy the class is 
Makes computer science interesting and fun for computer science people and arts  science people alike 
amazing professor the best i have had at tufts super friendly jokes in class all the time comes up with really creative ways of explaining things always available to help outside of class dont be intimidated if you feel a bit overwhelmed during lecture because it all becomes clear in the labs and hws the labs and hws are pretty challenging 
Professor Hescott is an excellent professor and lecturer Hes so friendly and always very helpful Wonderful class 
BEST PROFESSOR EVER He is the reason I became a Comp Sci major Great class and cares about your learning 
Prof Hescott is such a passionate professor that he actually converted me from an IR major to CompSci He is dedicated to his field of study and his students he cares about people on an individual level and he makes assignments interesting and applicable to real world scenarios Dont take comp  or  with anyone else

Ben is a phenomenal professor who cares about his students and does everything in his power to help them with the material The topic of computation theory is hard  possibly one of the hardest in the discipline But Ben consistently went out of his way to get people where they needed to be The proofs could be hard but I learned a ton 
Absolutely one of the best I started the semester as an IR major and now Im considering comp scihes that good I had read the above comment about this happening to someone else and was sure it wouldnt happen to meguess not Take this class Ben is an amazing professor 
Ben didnt do well for comp theory At least three lectures were spent on clarifying homework which could have been resolved by having consistent definitions The lectures are not helpful there are not many classes you can fall asleep for  minutes and still keep track of whats going on  he spends half an hour drawing graphs mechanically 
Prof Hescott is very nice and is generally an engaging and effective lecturer but he often gets bogged down in such detail that he is hard to follow Also his examples and demonstrations are frequently more distracting than helpful 
Computation Theory moves abysmally slow we spend half of every  minute lecture reviewing When we start new material he spends way too long clarifying details that either dont need clarification or are irrelevant Covers about  minutes of new material and its so broken that you dont have the material all there in your notes Terrible lecture 
This man is the greatest professor I have ever had He knows what he is talking about makes everything easy to understand is extremely helpful and is overall a funny guy Take his a class with him its worth it 
Hescott is everything a good teacher should be Hes incredibly clear helpful friendly caring and AMAZING His Comp class is not the easiest thing ever but he will help you every step of the way If you need to take a computer science course take ANYTHING with him Absolutely stellar professor one of my favorite teachers ever 
Nothing else to say that hasnt already been said One of the best professors Ive ever had  take his class 
Ben Ben Ben So enthusiastic One of the best parts of the CompSci department You cant beat his pop culture references I really respect him 
Hes amazing at teaching advising and appreciating dinosaurs and popculture references IN THE NAME OF THE MOON 
My favorite teacher at Tufts so far Extremely helpful extremely enthusiastic about the class and what one can do with it down to earth in terms of expectations yet always pushing the class to do better His lectures and labs are also extremely engaging 
The rumors are true he really is an awesome professor 
Professor Hescott is an amazing professor He has an incredible passion for what he does and delivers funny and engrossing lectures He will take a long time explaining and reexplaining concepts  but this is good as he makes sure everyone understands everything The projects are difficult but there is a ton of help for them 
My favorite class Ive taken so far at Tufts further solidifying my love of Comp Sci enough to allow me to take the plunge in declaring it as my major Ive never met such a brilliant professor who also genuinely cares in the well being of his students Theres no hiding that Ben loves what he teaches its infectious 
He is an absolutely awesome teacher Take his classes 
Obviously one of the best Wait for his term to take the class 
Ben Hescott is an amazing professor with a special talent of making a fairly abstract discipline computer science very understandable to almost anyone 
Ben Hescott is hands down the best intro CS teacher Hes an amazing person and was an incredible advisor I wish I got to spend more time with him 
I dont know how hes gotten so many good reviews Hands down one of the worst professors Ive ever had Completely misled that it could be done with no previous knowledge Embarrasses you if you dont know the material yet hell only show you how things should be without backing it up with why Only likes or helps those who already know A LOT 
Corny jokes but only because he loves a casual class Loves people who share will slow down and repeat lesson to help those left behind

Gives little attention or care to those who have no prior knowledge even though it is an INTRO course Moves fast kind of condescending if youre struggling poor explanations of material very unorganized Funny guy tells some great stories but seriously take Mus  with someone else if its available 
Hes the greatest guy ever Not only does he have a fantastic taste in music but he also cares about you doing well AND learning Hes the nicest guy and just has the funny charming old man thing going for him Definitely take intro to music theory with him as an engineer its the greatest liberal arts class Ive taken thus far 
John is great Plus if you show up you get an A 
John goes on some rants sometimes but we love him for it Adorable and hilarious Call him DMac Hell love it 
He really is a great guy and tries to have fun while teaching 
Wind Ensemble is great with McCann Hes an extremely laid back professor who will give you an A if you just show up to rehearsals Its not competitive and its not too strenuous Hes a laid back kind of guy and thats the way it should be Great class Fairly solid conductor too 
Really upbeat professor very approachable never boring Tells funny stories and genuinely wants you to do well even if you need more time or help Class is fast paced so make sure to speak up if you get lost

Overall hes less than average Hes a very funny man Very little homework The problems with him are his clarity pace and encouragement He digresses a lot and I mean a lot The class requires some knowledge of the basics because he only glosses over the basics Also youre screwed if you miss one class Very hard to make up assignments 
Great Prof He really cares and wants his student to learn He also realizes you have other classes so the course load is very manageable I always look forward to class Some background in music is recommended he does not spend much time on the basics I would definitely recommend this class 
Honestly felt uncomfortable going to class because I never knew what he was talking about Moves fast and teaches in an unorthodox manner which only those with knowledge coming into the class seem to moderately understand and even then sometimes leave more confused Great guy but shouldnt be teaching 
Just do it Wind ensemble is fun good music good people and John is a great conductor He never guilts you and just wants you to show up to class and try your best

Great professor extremely knowledgeable about his subject and does a good job of explaining it most of the timeIf you ask a question he will try his hardest to answer it and reexplain it If you skip you will fall behind because he does move kinda fast Hilarious guy and just wants his students to do well 
Though it is an intro class the professor assumed everyone had knowledge of the topic already He taught to the highest level of knowledge and when asked to clarify topics he usually just repeated the insufficient explanation already given I taught myself almost all of what I learned in this class Take this course with a different professor 
Great teacher really wants students to succeed Hes also really in tune with adapting to different peoples skill levels Also a genuinely funny and nice person so I would definitely recommend taking his class 
He is terrible at explaining concepts and he does not prepare for his tests which are extremely difficult He is available for office hours but he lets all students into the room so that it is really hard to get your question across 
Prof Luallen is an excellent professor The online PowerPoints are a great notetaking aid bring them to class and take notes on them Lectures are clear and concise though a bit dry at first he loosened up toward the end of the semester Tests were fair and were generally curved so that the mean was a  Excellent prof excellent class

Definitely one of my Top  professors at Tufts Great in lecture on average just  hours of hw per week and awesome guy in general Tests are tough to most people but they are definitely fair As long as you do some of the practice exams take notes and pay attention in lecture and do the hw youll do great 
Hes got a really loud and clear voice which was helpful in getting myself engaged As long as you do the reading the lecture will be helpful in filling in knowledge gaps that you might had Hes really helpful if you ask for it Not a lot of work Test questions are usually applications and arent that hard but tricky 
After my Intro to Economics class and having such a terrible teacher Luallen was a welcome break If you are able to keep up the class is great and Luallen has a great grasp of the material and how to teach it If are not an econ major or pretty good at economics dont take this class otherwise its a must 
Hes really passionate about economics and it comes through in his lectures Granted it doesnt necessarily mean youll understand everything that hes saying He moves pretty fast and it can get a little difficult to follow along at times 
Hes a little overrated He is a very clear lecturer and he makes his expectation well know You should be able to leave the class with a firm understanding of microeconomics but that doesnt mean that will become your passion Lectures can get a little dry but being able to print the PowerPoint slides is very helpful Solid but not great 
Luallen is by far the most difficult professor Ive had at Tufts Although he is a really nice guy who clearly enjoys teaching economics he prides himself on being the most difficult teacher for the course and his tests are very challenging I would definitely not recommend taking his section of microeconomics 
Luallen is great Like the other comments say he is really tough Probably the hardest micro section at Tufts That said I have also learned more in his class than I have anywhere else If you are a serious major take it with him If you are a minorjust thinking about econ take it with someone else This is coming from someone who did well 
He is a really good proff He knows his stuff and is extremely willing to help His powerpoint slides can get boring but he himself is an interesting and fun guy His class is really fast paced so be prepared for that But he will come over weekends to give extra office hours If you are planning on taking EC take him 
Professor Luallen was one of the best professors Ive ever hadever Class is VERY fair will often curve grades because he feels you guys deserve it even if class average is above  Hell take time out of his busy schedule to give review sessions and help you individually If youre thinking of taking EC make sure you get Luallen 
Professor Luallen is a really nice guy unfortunately he talks really quickly Make sure to be able to write quickly because he didnt put up the slides on blackboard until the class made him do it Definitely a powerpoint driven class If you go to his office hours hell be more helpful than he is in class 
TEST HEAVY 
LECTURE HEAVY 
AMAZING LECTURES 
Definitely recommend Luallen for Ec  man is a stud Harder than other sections but definitely worth it and the workload is not bad just study a lot for tests 
Luallen is a superstar You will learn everything there is to know in EC if you take his class Youll only get a B because his tests are so hard but if you care about learning the material then you need to take his class Hes also just an awesome guy and hes great at helping you out if you get stuck  he really cares about his students 
He teaches Economics for nonEconomists If youre not a major Id recommend him hes a good lecturer and hell hold your attention If you are a major stay away Hes more about the Blind Mem than the theory 
Professor Luallen teaches Micro the best amongst all the professors because he has great slides and illustrations Good for a foundation class because youll understand the models so well that you can apply them nicely on higher level classes 
His lectures can be boring but he definitely has a sense of humor Test grades received are not negotiable but he curves reasonably and never down Class attendance isnt mandatory and reading the textbook is very helpful for succeeding on the exams Finally hes a very adorable professor a lot of random sports and movie references 
Luallen is an excellent professor and amazing lecturer His slides are very clear and he is able to get his points across in a very concise and easy to understand way Rarely if ever was I bored in class That being said this was also one of the most challenging classes Ive taken Significant learning comes at the cost of an easy A 
Luallen is a good prof really enthusiastic in lectures very helpful in office hours Tests are considerably harder than problem sets so extra help and obsessive studying is a must 
RESPECTED 
Hes the reason Im an economics major The building blocks I learned in his class have made all my other economics classes easier 
Hes a great professor He now posts his power points which have absolutely everything you need to know His tests are extremely fair and relatively easy in addition to a generous curve He is clear interested in his students and more than willing to help Definitely better than other EC profs Ive heard about 
Professor Luallen is fantastic So clear and enthusiastic One of my best professors Tests are hard though 
Amazing professor Clear funny and very organized You dont even need to go to class if you have all the power points and can get hold of the in class exercises Tests were pretty easy and he doesnt curve down 
Professor Luallen knows his content well but tends to go through the material very quickly so some postlesson reading may be required His tests tend to be really hard much harder than the other professors teaching the same course but he curves very generous and most people end up doing well because the tests will become easier over time

Very good professor Makes micro easier to understand and gives concise lectures 
Made stats interesting and enjoyable if you can believe it Tests were not too bad if you attend class 
He tries to be clear during lecture but just ends up rambling on about too many topics for each class Most exams had tricks on them and werent straightforward He is helpful during office hours He is terribly slow at grading and takes literally forever to grade exams He does not try to make the topic interesting at all so hes very boring 
Downes was a phenomenal lecturer and worked at a reasonable pace He is a tremendous help outside of class and has extra review sessions before exams

I took both of Professor Downes upperlevel electives Ec  and Ec  and loved both of them His lectures are crystal clear and pretty engaging and he is very very helpful in office hours and over email He is also about as straightforward a professor out there  no tricks Take a class with him it will definitely be worth your while 
Explains well in class Changes the accents on topics that is some topics are covered in more detail than others Not always a good choice My advice is take stats with him he will make it more or less interesting and understandable

Great class and one of the best econ professors at Tufts Crystal clear lectures and expectations Tests are easy as long as you go to class and the research project should be interesting as the topic is of your own choosing Downes is very helpful in general and especially with the final project 
He loves statistics I hate it now cuz he cant teach it but he really enjoys himself while hes up there

Downes is by far the worst professor Ive had at Tufts so far Not only are his lectures dry and boring but he also does a horrible job explaining the concepts He simply rights down definitions Because of this how you do in the class mostly depends on your memory Tests and problem sets are like practice problems except much harder 
Professor Downes is a great professor He presents difficult material in a very straightforward manner and takes the time to write down everything he says on the blackboard ensuring you have enough time to take notes He doesnt try to be interesting but hes  clear 
Best professor at Tufts 
clear lectures 
Professor Downes is an awesome professor I have had him for multiple classes He knows so much about the subjects he teaches and is super helpful in office hours He writes everything down on the board so depending on how you learn it can be really useful 
Professor Downes is great 
you can tell hes passionate about statistics but he is not clear while lecturing statistics too many problem sets one due every week the tests were not that bad but the class average was low its a hard class i wouldnt recommend it unless youre an econ major 
Professor Downes was very helpful and very clear Hes as straightforward as a professor can be so there are no tricks Hes a nice guy too 
I dont understand why people believe he is a good prof Lectures are WAY too slow The examples he works at class are just dumb You can certainly pick up all the stuff on your own and learn even how to prove the theorems which he omit a lot in class but you definitely need them in order to understand truly how stats works

Downes is awesome His lectures are very clear and the material is generally presented in a way that flows naturally Hes super accessible and super super helpful outside of class He definitely cares a lot about his students and really wants everybody to do well and understand the concepts Would recommend any class he teaches 
Best prof at Tufts bar none 
Horrible He lectures in a disorderly fashion using abstract and confusing examples He then says that complex topics and equations arent important but they show up on the exam Lecture slides are just out of order and unclear Only reason I did well is because my brother is a med student and he tutored and warned me against physic in general

One of my favorite professors Hes taught physiology  times and its amazing No power points just pictures that he draws on the white board and hes so funny and engaging Hes now my advisor and Im taking another class with him this spring Tests are all multiple choice study and youll get an A 
This class was taken at BU where he taught a Cardiopulmonary Pathophysiology course This spring semester will be his last at BU so I thought this would be more fitting in his Tufts page I found him to be a great teacher but tests had some very specifictricky questions Very helpful and clear I learned a lot and it will be helpful for med

Took Physics  over the summer at Tufts and I can say that his lectures were unhelpful He will bombard you with a lot of unnecessary and confusing information in lecture Read the book and plug n chug equations is this class in a nut shell Hes an incredibly nice person but hes one of those too smart to teach kind of people 
Hes a nice guy and he tries hard to keep the class interesting with lots of cool demonstrations but in the end it just feels like youre going through the motions to pass Tests are not easy but not hard by any means 
Dry as plain white toast Decent class though with fair grading

I feel bad for Napier He truly cares about his students and wants to see them succeed but is also bright and knows what hes talking about However he doesnt lecture very well and does not take very good command of the room People constantly talk over him and it is very difficult to receive information during lectures 
Honestly I love him Hes adorable and you can tell how cool he thinks physics is So many demos Give him a chance Love this class 
He is smart but does not know how to teach His lectures are very boring and either repeats information from prelectures or gives too advanced irrelevant information However he is a nice guy and tries to prepare you well for exams with past exams and office hours The tests are open book so take notes 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
Quite boring and slow in lecture Youll need to work hard out of class to make up for it 
It is hard to rate this class because it was so boring His overheads were hard to read and he never does real examples sometimes he will plug in numbers Two tests and a final both are open book and open notewhich makes it hard to study for He is such a good guy so if you show your interestedmake sure he knows who u are then it will help 
Class was kind of a joke all you had to do on tests was find the right formulas and plug them it lectures were pretty confusing although he does try Tests are open book so pretty easy 
Hilariously bad Based on his own book which is somewhat like an attempt at a drawn out Vox explainer with hyperbolic conclusions drawn from case studies Steven is a pretty lousy public speaker Overall hes a pompous old guy trying to be hip throwing around buzzwords and wearing an Apple Watch but its clear that his knowledge is dated

PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
I had professor Stiffler for English  He is a deep thinking guy who is excited about exploring the ideas behind literature We had many interesting class discussions His grading is a little inconsistent among students but overall great guy 
His is a genuinely kind teacher His class is mainly based on discussing reading material and peer editing If your classmates dont talk class will drag on But he gives a lot of freedom on assignments and is very helpful with his comments on drafts 
SO FLIPPIN DRRRYYYY  but he tries If you show effort that would probably bump up a grade thats on the cusp Sometimes grading is arbitrary Use the academic resource center and get other people to edit your paper Then he sees effort and grades higher you dont have to do the reading but its not half bad youll have some discussion on it 
His style is more discussion based and he is a HUGE believer in peer revision and multiple drafts Its helpful to talk to him about your paper ideas before you start writing them so you understand what hes looking for Overall a really nice person who helped improve my writing skills 
Great guy Slightly spacey at times but cares alot about making sure his students improve in their writing abilities Very helpful in office hours Classes tend to drag a little bit with peer editing but get a good group and theyre productive Class pattern is very predictable

loved this professor very clear in his expectations and a fairly easy grader the reading material assigned really helped in writing the papers 
Stiffler is incredibly wise and good at directing students thoughts In class  and in his comments on papers  he can be a little bit vague but in his office hours hes incredibly helpful He really likes when students go to his office hours I didnt ace this class but I learned SO MUCH Definitely worth it 
incredibly nice and invested teacher cares about the students ability allows for a lot of creativity with assignments Class consists of a lot of discussions of readings which can be boring if your classmates are boring also a lot of peer reviewing which is mostly unhelpful unless you have a good student working with you

The best way to improve your grades is to go to his office hours Professor Stiffler is extremely helpful  on  and makes your writing way better Class can be really boring but you just have to show up The only grades are   page essays and an oral presentation based on short stories that you discuss in class You dont have to do the readin

He was really nice and cared about how you did in the class The papers were pretty clear and were the only graded assignments in the class I definitely recommend Professor Stiffler 
Stiffler is such a great professor I learned so much from him I went to office hours a lot and he was beyond helpful Amazing It is not easy to get an A or A in this class You will definitely work and truly push yourself to be better Hell help you too He cares about the students and enjoys what hes doing 
The actual classes are easy and there is not much work other than essays We have   page essays due this term and I dont really know of anyone who has gotten an A 
Prof Pollina was both my Prof and my advisor and I absolutely hated him If your French is anywhere short of native fluency he will make sure you know it and will make you feel horrible about it If I didnt love French so much my experience with Prof Pollina would have made me quit altogether I would never wish him on my worst enemy 
I really enjoyed Prof Pollinas courses He talks like Will Ferrells character from the SNL bit where he and Rachel Dratch are professors which his hilarious But he takes his students seriously and considers other viewpoints even when he obviously doesnt agree with them Just make sure you dont chew gum in class or wear a hat or anything 
He is better adviser than a teacher It can be hard to trust him He does not value ones opinionHe changes his mind very rapidly 
Since P loves similes Like Virgil who as Dantes guide through Hell continually insults and degrades the filth of the underworld only to baby his apprentice so P chastises his lessertalented read engineers students and lauds the Classics and Italian majors I do not feel I was on an even keel with other students and P didnt hide it 
Intolerant of other views Pompous Speaks in an English accent but is from New Jersey Why 
Not a fan Hes very pretentious and into himself He is however overwhelmingly intelligent which comes off mostly through his tangential ramblings If you already know something about medieval  renaissance literature or culture you will get more out of his classes than someone who does not Hes an excellent advisor though 
Condescending premajor advisor who made me feel bad about withdrawing from a course When I said that I found it difficult he said that other people found it easy Not everyone learns the same way or find the same things easy Im a scienceengineering double major by the way which is more difficult than romance languages 
As mentioned in some other reviews Prof Pollina can come across as arrogant and indeed I got that impression at first But hes really quite dedicated to his students meeting with them oneonone to discuss exams and their progress in the course Gives a very erudite and clear lecture though he tends to overuse the word stunning 
I have taken two courses with Prof Pollina People who dislike him for personal reasons simply dont know him well enough His comments are extremely helpful and hes not afraid to correct us when were wrong and to tell us why M Pollina is the best professor and scholar in the French department at Tufts and he is a great inspiration to me 
extremely pretentious but a smart and nice guy very easy grader 
Intolerant of opinions other than his own

Prof Pollina means well but my medieval French literature course taught in English was boring despite potentially interesting material He lectured the whole time and sometimes asked us to answer his questions but there was very little room for actual opinion He also made us go to office hours to get our grades which was uncomfortable 
Professor P is the best professor Ive had in four years at Tufts He corrects his students often as indeed an expert should Were there to learn And he NEVER corrects us to make us feel bad that other reviewer is crazy for thinking otherwise If you want a fun professor who doesnt really know the material he teaches go to Gasarian  
Awful He and the other professor were not clear and often couldnt be understood They tried to hard to make it a harder class to a point where it wasnt so much harder as it was unorganized They messed up and had to correct grades a lot and didnt seem to care about the students The observation project was not engaging Dont take this class 
I get that the class is supposed to be an easy science A but he couldve at least acted like he cared The material was hilariously simplistic and lectures were beyond boring Didnt learn a thing and it was a waste of everyones time Stay away 
The class wasnt a complete joke but it was still pretty easy I stopped going to class consistently and then stopped going altogether and still got an A If youre genuinely horrific at science then maybe it wont be as easy as I say it was but if youre looking for a science credit take this class The other professor was much worse

No this class is not an easy A but if you try at least a little you can easily do well Marchesini is really nice and he loves when students show interest He offers a ton of extra credit for going to every class which makes it easier to do well 
I took this class after Wanderers in Space to satisfy my Science requirement because I heard it was an easy one THIS WAS NOT THE CASE Marchesini is very hard on the matter cuz hes a hardo about astronomy A lot of tedious work and need to go to class to do well Not an easy A at all but rather a very hard A Language barrier  difficult exams 
Take this class if you are looking to fill a science credit May seem like a lot of info during lecture but once you take the first exam you see that you dont really need to pay attention Tests are VERY easy Multiple choice usually with  options Study the powerpoints for the tests and youll be fine And funny Italian accent haha 
Very interesting class Romero really knows his stuff Kinda like one of those talented college professors you see in movies and stuff It is a hard class you need to be at all lectures since there are no slides or anything posted and tests are kinda hard but they get curved to like a B Dont waste money on the textbook you dont need it

Professor Romero is one of the best professors that I have had so far his lectures are for the most part clear and his exams while long are not impossible He is such a good professor that I wish I could take all classes from him

Great cClass and pretty good prof As long as he can get the money you actually put out a national survey Pretty leanient grader and basically gives the same  lectures over and over again which is fine because u spend most of the time working on the survey definitly take the class 
Portney is not a BAD professor  I just think he is stuck in routine He is often funny  wants to be liked by his students This limits him in that he rarely challanges them Ive taken many of his classes and unfortunately have to say that I took more than one of them for the easy grade That said  there are definitely worse professors at Tufts 
he was a big disappointment class was boring and uninspiring 
Professor Portney is a very clear lecturer and he leaves all his ppt slides up long enough to take notes There is ALOT of reading in the st half of course that you have to do for the MC section of the final Which was the only issue I had with the course But he looks for reasons to bump up your grade and grades very easy on essays

Teaches from a topdown method giving students motivation for why the material is interesting and how the topic can be used in the real world I really appreciate the context he puts power systems into Homework is not required but is very useful if you want to do well on the exams He is a lenient grader 
He is a great professors easily one of the best Ive ever had He is young and funny this keeps his classroom comfortable and laidback But honestly he gets the most out of his students We all loved participating and he really helps students feed off of each others remarks He is a tough but fair grader and the course is designed well

Prof Lurz is absolutely wonderful one on one but his teaching style does not agree with me His classes focus heavily on sentencelevel meaning in the text and I found myself disagreeing with his reading of each and every novel I felt as though I walked away from class more confused than when I entered it and lacking a richer knowledge base 
Take an English class with him You will enjoy whatever you read and become interested in the text more than you thought you could Hes really nice approachable and friendly 
Prof Carleton is very enthusiastic but thats where his positives end He never actually fosters any kind of class discussion and wants you to parrot what he teaches back to you in essays every time Hes also quite abrasive if you try to talk to him after class and often singles students out in class and makes them uncomfortable 
Carleton is awesome Knows everything there is to know about the subject and gives great primary source readings instead of some textbook Very discussioncentered class always entertaining His sense of humor is a little offbeat though and if youre not on the same wavelength it might be hard to get used to 
Very cool guy although extremely vague about what he wants from essays

AMAZING LECTURES 
Simply the best Professor Carleton is definitely one of the best professor at Tufts University His lectures are simply engaging substantial eye opening and most importantly very entertaining His RUS class connects to people who has interest in popular culture and the narratives of war and how myth affects government decision making  
I did not enjoy his sense of humor and russian lit he was very difficult to follow he did not utilize the small class for discussion he only lectured us his essays were very open ended and you dont know what he wants no comments given on midterm essays or finals either 
Prof Carleton is extremely disorganized and untimely His essay topics are vague and he expects you to write exactly what he lectures in class He does not foster discussion but rather asks rhetorical questions for which he expects a certain answer his answer While his classes are interesting I cant say I learned anything 
A very cool teacher the class has a bunch of reading but most of it is either easy to get through or not really necessary to read There are two  pg papers and a  pg paper Fulfills an IR seminar credit 
Carleton is a nice guy and his lectures are always interesting but his prompts for writing assignments are broad and vague yet he seems to expect a certain answer The class isnt much work overall there are a bunch of movies in addition to books and short stories 
Whats great about Carelton is that hes really into what hes teaching he knows everything about it and he can even sometimes get you interested in boring things Some of the lit he has you read is excruciating and probably unnecessary but in the end it all kind of came together Funny guy too 
I love this man Hes hysterical and will keep you on your toes all semster I was also lucky enough to have him as an advisor and its quite tempting to select a major that he advises in just so I can have him all four years 
Hes a really engaging teacher because is so energetic and obviously interested in the class 
This class had no structure whatsoever Carleton was a nice guy but I didnt learn much and the essays were so openended that I had no idea what I was supposed to be writing about 
Carleton is passionate and is actually really funny Knows a lot about his field and picks great films even if the Russian ones take time to warm up to Would recommend to understand more about what affects a countrys collective identity 
great teacher really funny and talkative his russian lectures are very interesting and i always look forward to the class hes available for help and really connects with his students 
I think he is amazing He is one of the best profs at Tufts and if I had found out about him sooner would have taken many more classes with him 
Fantastic prof The reading is interesting the lectures are engaging and funny and hes just an allaround awesome guy Yeah the assignments are a bit vague but he never tries to screw you and generally if you go to class youre good Awesome class taught by such a boss 
Amazing class lots of really eye opening discussions Completely changed how I look a the Environmental movement He was very helpful and knowledgeable but honest about what he did not know 
Straub is an excellent professor He really wants kids to do well and his teaching style reflects that He may screw up here and there but he knows his stuff well and he tries to find the best methods to teach them to his class Great professor 
He solved a lot of problems in class interactively he made the class participate His exams are hard but he grades them fairly and gives a lot of partial credit I would recommend taking him after EC as hell give you good insight on how numbers and math work in econ and guide you to understand it all He also has his occasional funny remarks  
I thought since taking Macroeconomics with him that he may have changed but now way This professor lacked every quality that you would want in a professor He would grade papers without reading them and constantly made comments inferring he doesnt care about how you do The fact he is teaching at a university like tufts makes me want to transfer 
Awful professor Grades you based on whether he likes you or not Gives no understanding of econometrics and gets upset when you know more than he does Skips over stuff in class he doesnt immediately get leaving you stranded when its on the test How he gets paid for this is beyond me Avoid at all costs dont waste your time with him 
You will leave this class with a very strong understanding of microeconomicsbut that is if you make it through  of students drop the class and it is only then that his grade distribution matches the other EC  profs Hes a nice guy who does care about students understanding you should be ready to really work though 
Makes the class extremely interesting I dont understand why the previous raters say hes bad Hes not the conventional teacher and doesnt use PowerPoint Instead he does a lot of problems and gets the class to actually participate in solving them Hes funny and helpfulits the only class I never skipped or fell asleep in 
I thought Prof Zimmerman was excellent He taught real world concepts and wanted you to succeed He was not easy he really tested what you learned and was fair 
very boring lectures are basically reading from the book tests hard because you never learned anything he shows up late and lets you out early but when the tests come you realize you know nothing wont remember any of the material after the class 
Such a nice guy and really wanted you to succeed Although the class was challenging he was very thorough at explaining concepts and I felt like i learned alot Zimmerman made the class interesting and helped me reach my fullest potential 
I would have better invested my time and money on something else He doesnt teach anything in the classroom Overall very boring and I didnt learn anything from this class 
Zimmerman is pretty unhelpful He doesnt teach during class he just reads from really dry powerpoint slides When you ask a question hes vague and unclear Material wouldnt be difficult if he taught but he doesnt teach anythign during class so exams are pretty rough Our first exam average was in the s 
Not an easy teacher but was thorough with going through the material Took real life scenarios to make the class more interesting Overall I enjoyed the class 
Brilliant man really knows his stuff Zimmerman is willing to help and wants everyone to do well I put alot of work into this class but it payed off because I learned so much 
Dr Sonkusale has no interest in helping studentsHis lectures were totally disorganized and he did not show any interest to be a good teacher The homeworks were tedious and difficult Office hours were virtually not exist as hes not always there Do not take courses with him as you will not learn anything 
He really knows his stuff and can answer just about any question you throw at him and explains things well His classes both  and  require A LOT of work but you learn more from his classes than you will in any other 
he is a boring teacher who doesnt really care about his students success he is nice and his class was relatively easy we had  grades all semester not including tests or the one lab we had and it seems as though his course was unorganized 
Too much workload but you learn a lot 
Simply Awesome 
Boring teacher Talks fast and and is incomprehensible most of the time Disorganized course 
He wants to please the class but is very bad at teaching the material in class He does problems the entire time but in such a way that you do not get anything out of them Most boring class ever  hopefully he will get better as he gains experience 
Pfeifers a nice guy the problem was that he DIDNT TEACH He didnt always come to class and when he did gave a convoluted lecture and ended early The TAs tried but overall did not learn anything The class material wasnt hard but was presented in overcomplicated ways and graded ridiculously I hear Pfeifer wont be around much longer 
Nice guy quite hip Not the best teacher though Has potential Too new when we took this class 
Hes pretty bad compared to some of the other professors I have had at Tufts You would think that a professor here wouldnt have any problems with public speaking but you can tell he is really nervous and I think it hindered class learning Generally I felt that this class moved too slow mainly because his explanations are extremely wordy 
Agree with what most people have said Very nice passionate about the field wants his students to do well However the lectures are pretty useless the problem sets are very hard and the grading is hugely unpredictable Could not be happier that this course is ending 
Ok so hes not the best in the department but hes certainly pretty good He can be confusing at times and you dont really understand thermo after this class but hey thermo is hard He makes a huge effort always available very organized really nice and hes very biologically oriented Problem sets usually take  hours 
Not taught very well for such an important class Too much of the work was handed out to the TAs 
Professor Pfeifer is nice enough but that doesnt cut it when it comes to teaching thermodynamics I never felt like the material was actually taught During class he would go through long complicated examples that just confused everyone I have had to go back and learn the fundamentals of thermo for later classes 
He is so bad as the teacher It is unbelievable that he have no idea about what he taught compared with other professors in the department he did not taught you so try to avoid him take others classespecially for thermodynamics recommend professor jerry meldon 
I enjoyed the class Gives you an overview of some classic plays It is all discussion based and he really pushes for students to get involved However his assignments are very vague and a lot of time the class has no real structure but just kind of flows 
must be interested in material to enjoy class 
The cutest man in the world he rambles a bit when he is teaching but is learning he is the reason i am a major in this subject both directing courses are superb his knowledge and care for students surpasses anyone in the department 
Awesome professor Hes really engaging and tells interesting stories in class I couldnt have gotten through a  hour class with any other professor He really knows his stuff and can offer additional insight from his decades of experience in the field Jampel is the man 
Dr Jampel is a great professor Hes interesting entertaining and extremely helpful for those interested in clinical psychology There really isnt much work for this class  only one final paper The rest of your grade comes from class participation and role playing 
Professor Jampel is not an engaging teacher his lectures are long and tedious and he has a tendency to expound upon random uninteresting and inapplicable tangents The textbook is rarely discussed in class and yet the tests rely heavily upon it He does not effectively explain concepts or utilize his powerpoints 
Is not helpful and assignments are not clear 
Jampel is awesome He really knows what he is talking about encourages other opinions and is a great clinician I have learned a lot from him 
Clinical Methods Most of the course was doing roleplays where one student was a therapist and the other was a patient Jampel gave advice about how to improve and what things you did well Almost no reading MUST participate and critique your classmates during the roleplays Best prof Ive had for psych but he doesnt have real office hours 
Great abnormal psych teacher Clear and has experience tests were reasonable grading is reasonable too i had diff take on one test question and he accepted it Only problem was the class was  am on fri but he gave us a min break every time Learned a lot 
Dr Jampel is a great teacher Tells stories from his experiences working in the field to bring the material to life Tests are very reasonable and class is surprisingly interesting only problem was it was Friday morning 
Jampel is a wonderful professor for abnormal psych He is an experienced clinician so his anecdotes really bring the material to life I definitely recommend his class to anyone who likes psychology 
He was extremely helpful in explaining the concepts that were tricky Office hours were a lot of help

Terry is extremely passionate and an incredibly smart professor Sometimes his lectures can get a little confusing because he assumes you can think as fast as him but usually they are clear and helpful 
Good teacher sometimes class is boring but its not that bad He is knows his stuff and seems to like it a lot Test wasnt that hard 
Nice enough dude but he literally never explains anything and the homeworks are always painfully irrelevant to what we go over in lecture Just awful 
Knows his stuff and super nice if you go to him for extra help hes always happy to help which is especially useful since sometimes lecture and homework dont always correlate Super smart dude sometimes a little too smart for us students but ended up feeling like I learned what I needed to learn 
Terry has good intentions but Terry is a little confusing And he doesnt curve So if you rely on the poor scores of others to help your grade this is definitely the wrong class for you

Professor Cross is the best History prof Ive had at Tufts so far His lectures were always super engaging he teaches history like its a story is very helpful during office hours and is always willing to spark a class discussion or debate His exams and papers can be challenging but if you put in the work hell reward you Definitely recommend 
History of Jazz is kind of a mess In class he really just rambles randomly about various musicians and plays songs but you dont really get the feeling that youre learning the history of jazz so much as hearing anecdotes about several musicians Tests are hard and require a lot of study time Fun lectures but tough course 
Ullman is the man However dont think that you can just pass this course without working I listened to the tracks he gave us A LOT like all the time and I even had some difficulty on the tests The class is definitely an experience and I learned a lot I would definitely suggest it 
GET READY TO READ 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
HILARIOUS 
Interesting guy 
Ullman knows a lot about the blues but he tends to mumble and the acoustics in Granoff made it impossible to hear him Theres very little hw for Blues but dont underestimate how hard the tests are Memorizing the names artists genres and DATES of approx  blues songs is so very painful Oh and you dont need to buy the books 
HILARIOUS 
Professor Ullman is hilarious Often times I found myself going to class just to hear his jokes and funny tales about jazz musicians However the class can be kind of hard to do well if you arent super into jazz I am so I didnt have that problem 
Professor Ullman clearly knows and loves jazz music He has several personal stories to share about concerts and musicians The class is not overly challenging but does require a lot of time to do well The midterm and final consist of songs being played usually without words that need to be identified in detail  songs to know 
Ullman is extremely friendly and has a deep passion for the Blues Lectures often become dull but its still very interesting to hear about his personal encounters with various musicians Tests require a lot of memorization but Ullman tends to be an easy grader No knowledge of music theory is necessary 
Yes 
He was not very helpful in class but course was the easiest thing I have taken at Tufts Hes a very easy grader on exams and papers 
You always leave Prof Ullmans class laughing He has great stories and helpful critiques for improving students writing One of my favorite professors at Tuftsoverall incredibly interesting person 
best prof ever the best part was how he hid his secret life as an english teacher from his history of jazz students 
Very helpful and laid back 
this guy gives great lectures thats why class was great cool personal anecdotes about musicians we were listening to in class The papers werent that hard but the vast majority of grades was in tests which meant memorizaing of a lot of songs plus artists style recording date and analysis Tests are way harder than you think that theyll be 
coolest guy ever doesnt give a damn about grades or your opinion presents lecture with laidback ease to deliver good stories go to class you bums tests are stupid 
Ullmans lectures are not overly exciting and you definitely dont have to go but they definitely help There are two tests which are deceptively hard and one paper which is not hard The most frustrating part is his complete lack of organization I never found out how he breaks down grades 
interesting stories lectures can get boring but he adds in personal experiences which can be entertaining tests are ok but there are a lot of songs you are required to be able to identify 
Before i took this class I was into Jazz His class is neither relevant nor helpful He is apathetic of his students success and ignores the fact that students come from differentno musical backgrounds Unless you have musical background or are willing to study endlessly dont take it as it will ruin your interest in jazz as it has done for me 
I really liked this class but it was difficult because it was so fastpaced 
Nonfiction Writing in Talloires  Excellent course puzzling grading system Each day we would share our papers and critique them together Not everyone loves Ullmans sense of humor I thought he was great I was confused by my final grade because he graded everything at once at the end of the course Good choice for a Talloires course

Last semester this course did not do anything for me I like it now and the conncetion with biology is good Lectures are sometime too fast for a normal person to understand 
The protease and eznmye inhibtion types was very good One lecture was short but the clarity was very good 
The first semester was ok and disorganized Second semester was better 
Hes busy so a TA gives half the lectures They were both good but I woud prefer that the Prof took the time to teach the class 
Good professor

Professor Kumar is THE MAN 
I decided to go into Biotech or Pharma as a med chemist after this class Great classexams assignments were compressed in the end Did not like that 
High level stuff Im a philosophy maj and discussed Nietzsche during office hours instead of umpolung 
Kumar gave a lecture on prions and it was great He is awesome  He quikly made us understand the overall probelm of mad cow disease and scientific basis 
It is the middle of the semester and Prof Kumar was grate I wish he will do more lectures He can be funny but also probing what the class knows I liked it overall 
Guest lecturer I liked what he did with some cyclic reactions Entertaining and good with Thomas as a guest lecturer 
This guy is so intense he is downright intimidating But he knows his stuff Cold I would recommend learning from him Never have to learn it again Hard as nails though 
Professor Kumar was a guset lecturer But he blew everyone away He was excellent I ha d him for three lectures and wished he had taught the entire class Awesome 
I took  with another prof this was way better nice lectures and use of blackboard instead of powerppt 
INSPIRATIONAL 
Proteins as infectious agents Mad cow disease It was awesome 
One lecture was given by Kumar on peptide syntehsis and followed up by Prion Diseases Superb lecture and entertaining 
hands down the best science teacher ive ever had the true measure of a teacher is not general brilliance but the ability to convey difficult material to the average person kumar easily possesses both qualities 
Awesome teacher he knows soooooooo much and is very clear about teaching it His tests are very fair even though they are hard although nothing in organic chemistry is ever easy I cant imagine how hard the class would be without someone awesome like kumar 
This was a good class Kumar is organized although this class was taught by him half the lectures given by a grad student All in all I learned a grate deal 
Prof kumar is clear articulate and fun I have enjoyed this year of chemistry soooo much the exams are not your average exam and the poor sophomore who never took orgo is in so much trouble 
Brainy and a bit arrogant Knows a lot and knows what question a student is going to ask before they finish Enjoyed the two semesters and finished with A Gradning scheme is transparent 
I took his class at Harvard Honestly such an amazing prof His guidance and support was an encouragement for future classes Also he built a strong foundation for speaking writing reading and understanding Arabic I felt confident walking out of the class as did all of my peers and excited to attend the next class Highly recommend 
Amazing professor Doesnt waste time always teaching helpful things Work load is hard but to be expected from Arabic Tries not to laugh but generally has good sense of humor

Professor Beckman is very passionate about writing and traveling He will almost always support your essay ideas but he is a harsh grader He will always find something worth improving However he gives many opportunities for revisions and is highly available and helpful if you choose to seek him out 
Commited 
Prof Beckman really breaks down the writing process in a way that makes sense I never felt I had a really good grasp on essays until I took his course Really understanding in terms of extensions and pretty accessible when you need help Overall I learned a lot 
I can honestly say that i would never take another class with him again He is arrogant and not open to new ideas He spends his time telling everyone how he feels and if you dont believe what he believes or think the way he thinks then you are Wrong He limits thinking to be generic rather than unique Take course with another professor 
i love english and i hated this class beckman was a smug little man who i feel made my writing worse he wanted my writing to become something he approved of which really got on my nerves comments on papers were not particularly helpful either 
ABSOLUTELY THE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD I asked for help and he was unclear He decided that i was a B student after the first paper and wouldnt change his opinion I put a lot of time into the class and got nothing out of it I learned NOTHING He smells like smoke all the time Yuck 
Good teacher his heart is definitely in the right place Very concerned with the students doing work that reflects passion which overlaps my own needs from a teacher so it worked well for me Somewhat easy grader but whats important is what you walk away with I wrote the best I ever had leaving his class

Hes a great guy well travelled friendly and is happy to give you extensions whenever you need them Hes definitely a tough grader though 
This is the kind of teacher that wastes time trying to force his class to say what he wants to hear His comments can be helpful but not helpful with papers Once youve fixed some problem with your writing he finds another one that is worse than before He grades incredibly hard Dont take this class 
Interesting guy very energetic Course material was ok though some weird stuff He was helpful outside of class and is genuinly interested his students lives loves to travel and keeps in touch with former students Not too tough a grader and makes class fun by holding it outside sometimes 
Very interesting 
Difficult teacher difficult class learned a lot What you learn depends on your motivation A lot of people go in expecting to BS everything everything you write you have to make yourself Thus the inclass discussions are useless  useful at the same time Very helpful cares knows what hes talking about Doesnt look much at style though

Intelligent and humourous professor with unique understanding of American culture Theres a lot of readings for his seminar but classes are discussion heavy so you are really encouraged to do them Sometimes we get lost in discussion and the direction for papers is vague but definitely worth taking One of the best English literature profs here 
Prof Takayoshi made each class a pleasure to attend I would rank his course ENG   Intro to American Modernism in my top four classes that I have taken at Tufts in terms of enjoyability and amount learned I would rate the course an A and Prof Takayoshi an A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
Hes nice but I was not impressed 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
RESPECTED 
He is as well dressed as he is well versed in American Literature  would bang 
Definitely a brilliant guy and a nice professor assigns a lot of reading sometimes  books per week but reading all of it isnt necessary to participate If you do the work and put at least some effort into it youll get a good grade 
Takayoshi is an awesome professor He really works with each student to develop their analytical abilities and its easy to learn a ton from him He also has a great sense of humor and a lot of fun The workload is heavy but not overwhelming for an english class and the work graded very fairly with great feedback 
Hes brilliant and a great professor The course material was interesting relevant and tested fairly Hes a hard grader but the class is totally worth taking You learn a lot Be prepared to engage the material historically as well as through the literature perspective 
Takayoshis one of the best prof Ive had at Tufts and hes got such a charisma Incredibly humorous has a unique take on American culture and really helps you develop your potential Reading is heavy and since class is discussion based you probably should try to read them Also his wardrobe is just fantastic 
Great professor Professor Apeseche has a whole bunch of experience in finance It is clear he knows the material inside and out The class is not an Easy A By the end of the class you will have learned so much about finance Definitely recommend it Put in the work and effort and you should do well 
Great professor with lots of experience Not an easy class but workload is manageable His class is one of the most useful and practical class at Tufts if you want to go into the business fields Would definitely recommend it to anyone 
Professor Apeseche is a really smart guy His class is tough and you definitely get out what you put in workwise Classes are very long I wasnt crazy about his style but I definitely learned a lot I wish he would make himself more available for students especially to talk about careerrelated things since he has a lot of experience

GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
if you show up and smile you can get an a no problem Probst seems to know what he is talking about and also that everyone in class is asleep but I dont know that he cares all that much If you can bear to read even one of the outside readings you should be alright 
hes out there but hes awesome 
the decorated body africa and beyond what a bizarre class he is awesome though a true space cadet but does know a lot about african art entertaining and engaging 
Not super difficult but his test format is very confusing and makes the class significantly harder artificially Lectures are not engaging at all and grading criteria for projects is pretty cryptic Not very approachable Has a fun accent if youre into that type of thing 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
LECTURE HEAVY 
GROUP PROJECTS 
Interesting material presented in the most boring way possible His powerpoints have bizarre slides that looking at them again after class were completely incomprehensible making it very difficult to study for exams If youre looking for a nowork art credit this class is fine If youre looking for a class worth going to look elsewhere 
GROUP PROJECTS 
Cool accent boring professor 
Professor Probst is amazing His class Contemporary Arts of Africa got me interested in African arts something I had no idea I would find interesting He is so sweet and kind also A great teacher brilliant man and wonderful class 
Very smart man and very interesting course

Hes not the most amazing professor but you can tell hes smart and knows his stuff His tests and papers are pretty easy He might sound condescending but Im not quite sure if he is actually a condescending person Kinda hard to tell Just come to lecture you dont have to do the readings and youll get at least a B 
CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA 
I found the lectures to be very boring That being said its still easy succeed in the class Theres two easy group projects  test that are just memorization And a  pg paper He assigns reading every night but no one ever read Just try to stay awake and take notes and you should get an A This is coming from a kid who hates Art

Interesting class 
probably the best teacher i have ever had very clear with his notes and extremly helpful when you seek him for help makes his subject very interesting and easy to learn 
Professor Probst is extremely disorganized His class is super boring although I am not that interested in art I dreaded going every day Follow his examples for the papers and projects and you will do well Tests are basically memorization I didnt think it was very difficult to do well in but a few friends struggled 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
Definite gives you a new perspective on Africa and its art It was ok The projects were really easy 
Abnormal psych is interesting but cognitive psych is not His plain Powerpoint lectures are so boring that everyone either falls asleep or reads The Daily 
Although he is a bit boring to listen to he is very clear and does a great job of explaining difficult concepts clearly He is very aware that he is teaching an introductory course There are a lot of guest lecturers which keeps it interesting The tests are tricky if you didnt take notes or memorize the anatomy Exams are easy if you did 
Holcomb was one of the worst teachers I have ever had His lectures are very boring and uninformative He seems to lack enthusiasm for this material More so than anything else he is impossible to meet with outside of class Numerous times I tried to meet with him  I made appointments with him but he never showed up I STRONGLY do not recommend 
Holcomb is a good guy who cares about the subject this was my first psych class and the material we covered was interesting Id def take another class with him His lectures arent THAT bad 
Holcombs Psych class covers a lot of interesting material but imo his exams pretty bad Questions on his first two exams were poorly worded and the fillintheblank section was BStheres no way you wont lose points here If you do the readings take lots of notes and go to class youll probably do fine 
Solid teacher 
had great content about cognitive psych But even though i was interested in the material and he seems like a decent guy I COULD NOT STAY AWAKE lol Neither could my friends 
Incredibly dry lecturer Not his fault though he still loves the subject 
He was my first psych professor but at the time there were  others teaching along with him so they split the semester into  sections Anyway he doesnt smile too much and seems pretty serious I feel like falling asleep when I see him get up there and start talking Since class is pretty long I advise you to drink coffee 
Maybe not the most stimulating lecturer but if you have any interest in the material then he does his job and he does it well damnit Great guy totally willing to entertain questions excellent at explaining things excellent at making you think about things 
Hard to follow in a large lecture but I think he would be a good teacher in a smaller class 
Hes cool I know that for a fact because I know his kids well His test was brutal 
Some interesting material but it sometimes was hard to pay attention especially because it was a night class 
He clearly knows his stuff but is a little boring to listen to 
I could see the passion but his lectures are very dull If you can stay awake his lectures are clear and helpful 
Once you realize that the test problems will be exactly like past tests and psets your fine Its a guarantee that you will fall asleep in class Every day But go to recitation if you have problems do the old tests he gives you and make sure you understand those and youre set 
SO hard hes a great guy but the course was ridiculous 
good class if interested in chem but the guy cant really teach hes good at giving notes but make sure you have some good recitation TAs to teach you b ready to work labs are easy 
Dewald is an interesting character His problem sets are ridiculously hard and he designs his tests just so he can trip people up If you work hard the class is okay and you can get a Band he has an A in the final A in the class policy But the odds of anybody getting an A on the final are very slim 
Never have I had such a great professor He is HILARIOUS loves helping students gives plenty of notesold psetsold tests to prepare for tests Challenging class but he makes it worth it He also is known to help students on BA borderlines and he never gives A only As Overall Dewald is the man and I cant wait to visit him soon 
He is aweful He wouldnt be if he would cover more variation in types of problems and also if he would not skip steps You must know chem before taking chem  if you want to understand Dewald The man should learn to be more clear and not assume that his students understand the jumps he makes in his mind 
While he is nice and semiamusing in class with his views on politics try to avoid this class if you can He doesnt use any form of technology uses confusing notes and has a hard time explaining things clearly While you can get an OK grade in the course selfteaching the material is necessary and makes for an overall frustrating time 
He is really devoted and helpful It was not easy class HoweverI can have strong chem background which helps me a lot in dental school Of course DAT 
Took classes with him many years ago Best professor I ever had Not easy But fair 
Lectures not very clear but expects the student to do as much work as he does to learn the material Hes also so helpful in office hours one would think hes a completely different person outside of the lecture hall 
SO DIFFICULT I think its not meant for freshman if i were to take it again as a Junior id do much better in the class Helpful professor outside of class more direct and less ambiguous 
Dewald is a crazy man who loves to talk about booze and the war Look out for war stories about drinkin in Germany He loves to go off on tangents Entertaining but very hard to understand Youll be doing a lot of work on your own Helpful out of class 
Incredibly hard course but hes a good funny guy who loves talking about booze His notes are helpful upon close close analysis and the old problem sets are really helpful As long as you work your ass off this class is alright 
Its a hard class but its doable as long as you are willing to put in a lot of work outside of class His lectures can be confusing but they are worth it for his random rants about the government and environment 
Worst teacher i have ever had Lectures were impossible to follow Every test problem was intentionally made unfamiliar If you ever ask him for help in class or during a test hell just whine about politics and ignore your question 
I could have done better if Id worked harder or if he had been a better teacher Hes tough and he doesnt explain very well Some people really like him Its a taste thing He is funny though 
He is the most helpful professor Ive ever had Hes available  days a week even SUNDAYS lol Exams however were a  I put in atleast  plus hours of work a week into this course alone and still ended up with a B 
Dont take this class unless you know a lot about chem beforehand bc he didnt explain a bunch of things too well and you probably wouldnt understand unless you know what hes talking about already I hardly went to recitations but they always helped when I did go KNOW the psets if you wanna do well on the tests and you can sleep thru class 
Dewald blows Your better off skipping class and reading the notes on blackboard However he is often easy to take advantage of because frankly he simply dosent care Hey its close enough for Tufts Conclusion aviod this man big time 
Hated it No longer wanting to go to Dental school Not a weed out class Yeah OK 
Everytime I try to do a problem set I am amazed by how little Ive learned in this class Ive been to every lecture and Dewald does not teach the material he expects us to know He is also extremely discouraging to those of us who do not get the material saying that if we dont understand it we shouldnt be studying this subject 
You either hate him or love him not many people are in between If you already have a background in chem  LOVE it this is a good class dont take it if you are just fulfilling premed requirements because it is HARD Dewald is very nice  has some crazy stories plus you can call him at home on a sunday for help before a test 
He makes me not want to wake up on Monday mornings I never knew one professor could be so anal His notable quotables are the only things that keep me going to class 
To all you ambitious little freshmen do not take this class so it will look good on your transcript It is difficult Dewald is past his prime and you will be better off in CHEM The TAs were my salvation for this course I was just frustrated by Dewalds mindset of living in the s by December And exams at  AM 
very organizedand clear very intresting classmiddle ages extremely helpful professorwants his students to understand the class essays only and you can rewriteexcellent professor

Class material could be a bit boring sometimes but thats just the subject matter Marrone is a very very kind man He encourages you to see him outside of class to discuss papers which he gives excellent guidance on Three papers are the only grades so definitely take advantage Readings and lectures not mandatory but essential for papers 
Extremely clear pedagogical and a really nice guy too 
Marrone is a very knowledgeable professor He typically does a lecture and a discussion class per week  but you do not have to participate Three essays throughout the class Sometimes isnt the easiest to get help from but overall his classes are good 
Very very good professor Easy grader very helpful and caring about his students clear lecturer His lectures may drag on at times but if you find the material interesting hes fascinating to listen to 
I have taken numerous classes with Steve Marrone as well as having him as my advisor for undergraduate and graduate work at Tufts He is without doubt one of the best professors at Tufts He is a dedicated and caring teacher as well as being one of the leading scholars in medieval history

Professor Marrone is so helpful and you can tell he really cares about his subject matter The class material was not very interesting and lectures could be dry at times Lots of reading also required Only a few papers but they were graded very easily 
As smart and articulate as this guy is I could not make it through his class without his voice starting to drone out and cause me to fall asleep He doesnt enforce attendence so i rarely went only  assignments all year anyway If youre into it good if not take it for a credit and just chill 
Hes very nice and the material is pretty interesting However lectures can drag and you dont really have to pay attention A friend who took the class last year said that virtually everyone gets an A For myself and the other people I knew in the class it turned out to be correct 
Hes a sweet guy and really cares about the subject matter Class consisted of two lecture classes and one discussion each week but you dont need to participate if you dont want to gets awkward when nobody participates though Lectures can seem dry but if you actually listen they are very compelling 
Professor Marrone is by far the best professor in the history department and the only really great one in my opinion Always clear tremendous insight and open to discuss papers or subjects from the class in general 
He is the sweetest man love him to bits Enjoyed his classes they were interesting Sometimes I would get a bit bored The class was easy  essays for the whole semester and thats it So its easy to pay attention to only the bits you like

Kritzer is a good professor Hes engaging in lectures and has a lot of good insight Teaches the important stuff leaves out unnecessary fluff Textbook is really good too Definitely a lot of time outside of class doing problems Testsquizzesgrading are fair 
Truly the best science professor Ive ever had Really wants his students to understand the material and do well even though there was close to  of us I was pretty unconfident in my science ability after chem   but Kritzer made me confident that I can actually do science Hes always willing to help super intelligent just the best

Partha means well  will definitely help you with assignments including over the phone or via google doc But his lectures arent very clear  he tends to focus on minutia rather than fundamentals He assumes and teaches math concepts which are not taught until discrete math or algorithms and which arent really necessary for COMP

Hes one of Tufts most brilliant entertaining  engaging 
oh god dont take this so hard the tests are ridiculous please dont take it 
He is a really good lecutre very clever and interesting The test can be hard or easy depeding on what version you get but his curve is very generous Great way to get a science credit You will also learn a bunch of cool facts 
One of the best classes Ive taken at college He is super interesting and extremely engaging His lectures are a good mix between topics covered in the readings his own extensive experiences and his wry and hilarious sense of humor 
Flaky I had to make up an exam with him and was stood up  times Had to go to the dean of students to get bailey to show up on time 
Professor Bailey is one of the best professors at Tufts His lectures are always interesting and I enjoy going to class to listen to his stories His assignments are creative He grades fairly and there is usually a scale He genuinely cares about what his students think and he is engaging during office hours 
One of the best lecturers Ive had Class is always interesting though he sometimes fails to show up and always comes late A tough grader but worth the work 
He is a fascinating lecturer I loved listening to him However the exam system is a disaster There is a generous curve but Id rather get a good grade to begin with and feel like I earned it Also dont like the TAs at all He needs to be more involved 
Great lecturer Tests are hard and usually have a steep curve Really interesting class and I learned a lot 
frustrating he clearly knows his stuff and is a clever lecturer whose classes vary from sweet to bad but he jumps ALL OVER THE PLACE from lecture to lecture for such a smart guy he has an amazingly awful ability to segue or see the big picture 
Bailey is a great lecturer Hes engaging and funny if a little disorganized Hes brilliant and he knows it but that doesnt make him mean or a bad person Hes restructed his tests so theyre better than in the past Its stupid to expect an easy A Take it seriously pay attention work hard and youll do well and learn a lot 
very flaky in that hes always late keeps class late impossible to get ahold of and extremely disorganized redeems himself slightly with brilliance and enthusiasm but only slightly interesting class though 
Good he is a very interesting lecturer and class is actually pretty enjoyable to go to Bad he is extremely disorganized typically comes to class  minutes late and the tests are graded completely ridiculously and arbitrarily Do not take this class for an easy science credit  it will probably hurt your GPA

TOUGH GRADER 
I loved Professor Baileys class The lecture was really interesting and even as a nonscience person the topics were engaging He clearly knows a lot about this topic and is always happy to answer questions about specifics that interest you His tests are really dumb though and the class was pretty disorganized 
Anthro  with Bailey is definitely making me consider majoring in Anthro he is such a great lecturer very charismatic and very helpful Loved him 
no this isnt a great way to get a science credit Tests are unrrelated to lectures and test knowledge of stupid facts Lectures are numbingly boring TAs are arrogant Only take this class for a science credit if you are a masochist 
Bailey is a great lecturer He was very passionate about the topic of the class and was very knowledgable Hes also a human being so he was very approachable 
One the of the best lecturers i have ever had 
GREAT CLASS I learned SO much and became very interested in the material even though i originally wasnt Professor Bailey is great in my opinion Not super on top of things in terms of organization but a GREAT lecturer Hes really more of a story teller The first section of the course is a little dull but once it gets rolling its really ne 
His class is a disaster not organized very well you read  pages the first  months and then the rest of the book in the last few weeks and grades depend not on how much you study but on what color test you get do not take this class 
This guy is my advisor and he is THE HARDEST person to get ahold of Totally unavailable but the quality of his lectures makes up for it His classes are the hardest Ive taken but I keep taking them because hes such an amazing lecturer V challenging 
Hes hard on this class because he hates that people take it as their quoteasyquot science requirement Hes very passionate about the subject and a very engaging lecturer Hes also my advisor and although hes hard to get a hold of hes helpful about writing recommendations etc He is arrogant though 
Stephen Bailey is extremely knowledgeable about all things anthropology nutrition and biology Hes a good lecturer and the material is fascinating I thought that his tests were fair  I did the reading showed up for every class and did well There were three exams a final and a short paper Your lowest exam grade is dropped

i have never wanted to die quite as much as i did the semester that i took physical anthro 
Professor Bailey is a fantastic lecturer Class is always interesting definitely worth going However hes not very welcoming during office hours and his tests can be challenging I did well in this class but mostly used outsideprevious knowledge on exams Course load is not hard One paper one movie review three tests Readings were great 
This class was a joke He showed up late everday with his terminator glasses and TA posse Exams were ridiculous One of the questions was quotwhat is the name of the space behind a hominid toothquot Cmon give me a break 
Bailey always showed up late for class I was told this was a good science class for nonscience people but that was not the case 
Amazing dynamic lecturer 
Destpite the fact that the average grade for tests is a  there is a HUGE CURVE in the class so it really isnt hard to get a good grade when a  is a B Bailey is an amazing teacher and if youre interested in Anthro take this course 
I really enjoyed the course material and some of the lectures were fantastic but the exams were very difficult and hard to prepare adequately for It made the class very stressful and much less enjoyable than it could have been 
Professor is at least  minutes late every day Although if he is  minutes late you shouldnt get up and leave he might show up  minutes late and start his lecture Never responds to emails Is unwelcoming during office hours There is no structure to his lectures  study everything for exam Lectures are interesting 
His lectures have convinced me to become an anthropology major Lectures are always very interesting and interactive 
While his lectures are very engaging hes not going to test you on them Make sure you pay attention to the little things he glosses over but are in the book Youll learn a lot and his stories are definitely worth it 
I highly recommend taking a class with Bailey but do it PF Youll learn a lot Hes very knowledgeable enthusiastic and funny However taking good notes for this class was very hard Lectures are engaging but slightly disorganized Exams are graded very strictly and average  luckily he scales Lots of reading but theyre so interesting 
totally unfair grading and testing for each test there are two versions one version will be the test thats on reserve or that he gives out at the review session with the answers the other test will be  times harder 
yes this is a hard class yes it was interesting yes you ask yourself why you are a masochist for taking this as your sci credit but the lecture is amazing and he reminds me of House emotionless and insanly demanding but brilliant i loved and hated the class at the same time but i would still take it given the chance 
Such a smart intelligent professor and not bad to look at either Has been known to disappoint students by being somewhat flaky with office hours etc but makes up for it with his insightful lectures and knowledge for what he teaches 
He is always late to class exams are hard and usually based on lecture so you have to attend but theyre always graded on a curve Great lecturer though really engaging 
He is a fantastic lecturer and the material is fascinating But his tests are arbitrary and impossible and he doesnt seem to care about his students at all He will never respond to your emails All the TAs quit before the class ended because they couldnt deal with him

I LOVE Professor Bailey he was extremely engaging and the course material was manageable and interesting Definitely take this course if you are looking for an interesting and not overlysimple biologynatural science credit 
The BEST lecturer I have ever had Hard to talk to in person but extremely intelligent Difficult course however 
Worst teacher I ever had Cares more about student relations than students 
when you take the exams just make sure you know what he thinks is right and not neccessarily what a lot of others would tell you is He has a subjective sense of whats right and wrong but is not afraid present this as objective 
Bailey is not a nice person nor a helpful professor He often makes students feel stupid and illegitimate The reading is interesting but the amount is unmanageable His exams are impossible and you will not get the grade you want Last semester all three TAs quit before the final exam because working with Bailey was so awful 
WARNING FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS SAVE YOURSELF WHILE YOU STILL CAN 
Bailey has two prominent characteristics both of which are seriously unappealing He is incredibly arrogant interpersonally He is latefor EVERYTHING Hes a difficult human being Being smart does not offset the way he deals derisively with people 
he doesnt review for the final at all we have no idea what is going to be on the exam I am an idiot for taking this class Dont fall into the same trap 
Very interesting lectures Clearly delivers lectures 
LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWS Yes hes a great lecturer and yes the material is awesome but its not worth getting cheated out of a good grade because the man doesnt know how to write a test And I dont just say that because Im bitter Even though I am 
All the reviews saying Bailey is a bad professor are just coming from people who wanted better grades I didnt get the grade I wanted but Im not mad Why Because Bailey is BRILLIANT His lectures were funny and always on Yes it was hard to study for the tests but its because there was A LOT of info to cover It was not his fault you failed 
this was a tough class theres a good deal of reading and in class you have to keep writing down everything he says the tests are VERY tricky  you must know EVERYTHING he could ask ANYTHING some material is quite interesting though good but tough 
I knew to be scared when he said that avg test scores on exam are about  But I took the class anyway It was interesting but based all on theoryso basically you spend your time learning stuff that isnt even concrete science Also his TAs are evil 
Not very concise in lectures and found him to be a bit preachy Im okay with him being late except when he then ran lecture late This happened too many times 
Knowledgable and passionate about human relations He went off on tangents with the students during lectures buthe has a radar so the discussions help in further studiesTests should be more relevantInproperly covers material taught in class Late alot

TEST HEAVY 
Gives really good notes on his lectures which I found hard to follow because they go really fast Encourages going to office hours Grades problem sets very liberally and tests less so 
His lectures are confusing and he tries to derive the formulas behind the models he is teaching It turns out to not be necessary because you are not going to be tested on it If you study for the tests you will do fine 
Class has A LOT of models which Prof Fusillo tries to explain but does not do a very good job at Tends to mumble to himself a lot but goes through the material with good pace Exams tend to be hard and not very illustrative of class material 
Incredibly kind man word to the wise go to office hours and read his notes Macro is a tricky subject but if you put in the effort you will go far He is so so incredibly kind and amazing at explaining things if you give him the chance I recommend fully 
CARING 
First off Mike Fusillo is a saint Unfortunately hes a tragically disorganized mumbler and your best bet for grasping the course material is to just tackle the monolith of notes he posts on Trunk for each lecture on your own Do not try to do all the lectures in one night because the material itself is not easy to master Go to office hours 
People flounder in Fusillos Intl Trade class for no good reason He lectures clearly the material is intuitive if you understand Micro and the exams are exactly the same as the problem sets which are the same as the inclass examples The final is ballshard compared to the midterms so if you dont do well at first its a good class to drop

Prof Fusillo is a very nice and extremely available person but also a very confusing professor sometimes He is always there if you need him and his office hours are amazingly helpful and thus crowded Nevertheless the crowd is also due to the fact that classes can be very confusing lot of numbers but too few words to explain them 
Not an Easy A at all exams are hard

Really helpful in office hours 
I was afraid to take this class bc Id heard about how difficult it was but Professor Fusillo was a great His lecture notes he posts them online are hugely helpful and a written version of his class lectures Also hes great during office hours and really wants you to succeed The class is tough but if you put in the time you can do well 
Wish he taught more classes His macro course was very interesting and although he did go through derivations on the board you werent expected to know them for the exam Problem sets were challenging but manageable really helpful in office hours Very clear lecturer with a good sense of humor 
Speaks and writes really fast in class which makes it difficult to take notes Also doesnt help that problem sets have little to do with the lectures and there is nothing posted online about them

one of the best teachers ive ever had take him 
knowledgeable about economic development pretty helpful outside of class 
If you are an independent student and really can teach yourself with the book go for it If youd like to have an interesting professor to bring the material to life not so much He is nice though 
Hes a great professor Econometrics can be a very confusing subject but he presents the material in a way that students can really understand 
All the other reviews sum this class up nicely He is a good professor but not extraordinary He is clear smart and gives you the resources to do well however the class is not very exciting and it is difficult 
Very Helpful guy I loved him Nice funny and easy going 
This class is the hardest class Ive ever taken It took me two semesters and a withdrawal to get through it but I definitely got it by the end He teaches the material thoroughly and clearly he keeps you focused with weekly quizzes and HW but he is brutal when it comes to exams

Prof Joseph was definitely a great professor who has a lot of enthusiasm for this course There were a lot of readings that you had to be familiar with in order to write the papers well He was very friendly and brought in donuts occasionally There is also a community service project involved in the course Overall definitely take his class 
Globalization and Social Change  it is a very abstract and complex course The readings and ideas are all theoretical and are more geared for an advanced student in Sociology However the only graded assignments  essays are very manageable

nice guy definitely has TONS of interest in what he teaches but he makes it kind of easy to space out in class 
One of the few classes I have looked forward to attending Each class has productive discussion and one can really learn a lot from the material taught If you work hard you will do well and attending class will allow you to stay on top of your work

This class is what you make it If you stay on top of readings attend class and pay attention and partake in discussions then its a great class Interesting material Professor Joseph is clear TA was also helpful Midterms took a while to grade but were returned with thoughtful comments and was obvious that care was taken in grading

He has his own opinions about the course material and makes them very clear but he listens and engages with other points of view and is a fair grader The sociology theories are a little basic and I wouldnt recommend for people who have taken a lot of sociology in the past Overall I had a very good time in his class 
His style of teaching at first seemed ideal no one can know absolutely and theres validity to every opinion but in the end it resulted in a class where no one including the professor knew what they were talking about and nothing substantial or definite could ever be discovered A lot of work toothree  page papers Still worthwhile though 
He really cares about his students Such a sweet man  brought tea and scones on the last day I appreciated that he always made time to meet with his students outside of class 
What a guy Super helpfulattentive Best choice for an advisor in the department 
I found him to be rather refreshing because he takes a more academic approach to the subject than other professors in the department But he seems to make things TOO academic complicating matters and bordering on arrogance He is also very difficult to get a hold of and has not responded to one email Ive sent nor does he remember my name

Professor Thomas is a brilliant scholar who could be a brilliant professor if he was willing to cultivate his students in a way that allowed for generative thinking and reflection in class Unfortunately this is not the case with GT It is really either his way or the highway and that makes it very difficult to be an avid participant 
Just so random people know Prof Thomas is super controversial here and so youre going to get polarized opinions on this site You should probably take a course and decide for yourself if you like his views or not Gradewise youll do fine no matter what though if you do the work 
Not a very clear communicator Difficult to get in touch with outside of class 
GET READY TO READ 
BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
Hes resistant to critique about the reading so be careful with that If you can repeat what he says back to him during the few discussions youll be fine Hell lecture the entire class but he wont lecture on what you read Do not recommend this class but if you must take it watch for the  pop quizzes throughout the semester 
Prof Greg Thomas is a horrible teacher in general He does not work to nurture the growth of his students but just wants students to agree with him I dont find him a supportive teacher at all but someone who wants attention and only wants students to regurgitate what he says Doesnt help us think for ourselves 
Prof Thomas speaks about necessary topics imo I love radical black polcommentary but hes negligent of how biased his views are He clearly favors regurgitators and doesnt provide space for dissent He poorly encourages safe participation  prefers a Socratic method that puts students on the spot often and privileges students hes closer to 
Smart guy but doesnt really seem to care about teaching or making sure students learn Went to his office hours once and he was on his phone the whole time and didnt really pay attention to my questions Also texts in class sometimes You might learn something from the course material but hes not gonna do much to help you out with that 
Yes he knows his stuff but he is an awful professor He doesnt care about his students and dismisses anyone whose opinions arent in line with his Also extremely rude in class and during office hours so youre basically on your own to figure things out Do not take his classes

You will learn so many new things with Greg Thomas You dont want to miss a day he is so knowledgeable People have VERY different opinions on him but take at least one class with him the topics he teaches are cool The midterm and final are  page papers The reading can be overwhelming at times but you can get through it 
Really helpful at office hours very difficult class and will make you work and see things from a variety of angles No wrong answers in class but you have to done the readings and analyzed them well Energetic but friendly guy uses his phone sometimes in class which is weird but I assumed he was looking up stuff Thats my only complaint really 
Did not learn a whole lot in this class Lectures are very unfocused and rambling Doesnt allow for student participation most of the time but will call on you and force you to speak Went to office hours a couple times and left more confused than before

GregGGat is the best teacher I ever had His class so good that I didnt feel like doing work for any of my other classes while I took it He really gave me guidance and exposed me to so much amazing material Some people cant handle Gregs realness hence the low scores on this site but if you can then I promise you will love his class 
He doesnt like questions in class Just a very difficult professor to learn from 
One cool dude super smart and nice Hard class though but worth it 
Extremely helpful and nice His class is fun and informative Always reponde to your email 
not intentionally hilarious 
Professor Tu is the best Calc III professor I tell all my friends to take his section Standard workload for a math course homework sets due every class  midterms and  final Lectures are VERY informative take lots of notes he pretty much writes them on the board for you Homework is helpful too

Tu is not only a good professor but a very friendly and helpful guy Once he gets out of his shell you realize that hes super passionate about helping the students and he loves what he does Definitely would recommend 
He is so helpful funny and knows what he is doing 
Prof Tu made this class slightly more frustrating than it should have been I wish he would have just presented the material as boring as it was but he instead wanted lots of class participation and often ended up wasting class time leaving too many things to be learned independently outside of class Homework is very hard but tests are fair

AMAZING LECTURES 
Tu allows students to obtain not only a rigorous mathematical understanding but also an intuitive and historical perspective on material The golden nuggets lie in his sense of humor anecdotes and bits of selfreflection which truly flesh out the process of mathematical inquiry Clearly Tu is incredibly inspiring and is loved by all students 
Professor Tu is a wonderful professor He is thorough clear and enthusiastic The course gets progressively harder but Professor Tu works hard to teach as much material as possible Take advantage of his willingness to answer questions outside of class Dont fall behind at the end of the semester the final will hit you like a ton of bricks 
Tu is amazing He gives great notes and he is very funny I loved going to his class because he makes the material make sense 
These were my favorite courses and a good deal of that is because of Prof Tu He was so much fun Who knew anyone could be that enthusiastic about group theory But I loved the class and he made it so much fun 
Hes a great guy and a very good lecturer his tests are easy you learn everything doing the homework Would definitely recommend him

He is usually wellprepared for class and knows the material well He wants everyone to understand the subject and sometimes this leads him to lengthy wandering He may seem lost from time to time but its only because hes reflecting on what the best way to answer a question is A bit shy but give him some time and you can see how great he is 
He was a pleasant amusing professor Not always helpful in office hours but his lectures are fantastic Standard math workload 
This eccentric chinese man with a chinese american french accent presents the material with clarity and is fond of bringing in props to class but it helps to understand the D aspect of Calc  He is a little hard to get ahold of but hes very helpful one on one Also he knows everyones name in a class of

Its hit or miss with him If he likes you youre all set If you end up not being his favorite then heads up Youll definitely have to put in some extra effort to get the grades

A surprisingly demanding but entertaining course Anyone who enjoys watchingreviewing movies should definitely consider enrolling He may be a tough grader but his feedback will improve your writing and perhaps even your analytical skills He may even sharpen your taste while youre at it 
Very knowledgeable professor and interesting to talk to outside of class However lectures were very boring when hes not showing clips He basically says what the slideshow has just worded slightly different Its a useful and interesting topic but I realized that I can easily just google what I learn in this class 
Subject matter wasnt the most interesting but Professor Irwin tries hard to make it so Kind of felt like I was wasting time being in lecture Recitations were pretty much pointless too Probably wouldnt take this class if I could go back in time and reregister but I almost kind of understand health care now 
Irwin is a baller Sometimes his lecture is boring but guest speakers are awesome and def seek him out outside of class 
hes the worst he talks to the blackboard and is super unclear Not worth not doing well in this classget last years exams ahead of time 
A useless professor Offers to help answer homework problems then doesnt solve them or gives useless info The worst professor Ive had al of sophmore year Ive never learned so little in class been so bored or relied on my book so much Hes also a  he favors men highly above women

Wayne Chudyk is probably the poorest teacher Ive had in all of engineering aside from freshman year half credits he has NO enthusiasm for the course and provides very few real life applications class is a complete bore youll learn more from the TA than from Chudyk 
THE worst tufts prof ive had made me want to switch my major but if you are an env engineer not all hope is lost he is the worst in the dept but everyone else is awesome avoid intro to env eng with chudyk 
Prof Chudyk is a pretty good Professor His explanations are pretty clear and he seems to be enthusiastic about the subject or at least as enthusiastic as one can be about stats Hes also friendly towards his students and does seem to care about their success 
though boring but you learned basic data analysis 
Professor Chudyk if youre reading this thanks for absolutely nothing 
Great professor as long as you show up to class the tests are easy 
Okay so his lectures are extremely boring though he does try but he does a decent job of explaining the material and he organizes the class well Occasionally he will throw a curveball on an exam but they are usually open book He does seem a little cold but he is helpful if you ever ask him for anything 
This class isnt easy to teach because its very broad and covers a lot of subject material quickly but Fio did a great job of it Hes a really charming guy and is very genuinely interested in BME And he sincerely wants students to do well  makes an effort to clarify test material ahead of time He has a sense of humor too Great professor 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
Lots of material is skimmed over because it is an intro course There was lots of homework and the professor often was not in class so the TA did a ton of work which made the grading tough 
Awesome professor Funny but collected Interactive and responsive Organized and able to improvise Sometimes he has difficulty expressing himself because English is not his first language but he more than makes up for it with everything else Wish he was staying so I could take more classes with him 
Prof Lopez is an awesome guy He was always available outside of class for his students SO accessible and helpful via email and very friendly and relatable I enjoyed his casual funny demeanor in class which made learning sometimes dry material more fun 
Alberto Lopez was excited about his subject and made his class fun Hes sarcastic and scary in class but actually really helpful and lovable A musthave teacher 
Got an A without buying the textbook and only showing up to Albertos lectures Alberto is knowledgeable and entertaining as a lecturer and has no problem explaining topics in extra detail if a student requests it 
Alberto is a phenomenal professor whose passion for Mathematics shines through in his teaching style What surprised me most was his devotion to his students even when he wasnt obligated to help his students Alberto made time in his schedule to ensure his students had the help they needed  all in all a caring brilliant man 
Linear Algebra with professor Lopez was a hard class and while the material was tough he really listened to his students and was very helpful outside of class He even had a review session for us when he had family visiting 
Hes awesome and super nice and helpful 
Great Professor who is genuinely interested in his students learning and progress You will get the most out of Alberto if you seek him during Office Hours 
best class I have ever taken at Tufts 
Clear enough Really helpful during office hours He really cares about students 
I would highly recommend taking any class with Alberto He has a laid back attitude but he also makes sure that his students understand the material Lectures are clear and to the point He definitely has all qualities that a student would want in a professor As far as difficulty goes what you put in is what you get out 
Hes an awesome professor Super helpful and if he was staying I would reccomend him to all my friends 
Linear algebra class with Prof Lopez was definitely challenging but aslo extremely rewarding His tests are tricky but he prepares you really well for the final which is written by him and another professor He is SOO willing to help outside of class and really goes above and beyond for his students I really recommend him as a professor 
Its a pretty standard Calc III class Alberto is pretty laid back clear in lecture willing to double back and make sure you really understand whats going on and extremely helpful in office hours His accent is not bad at all 
He is a hilarious teacher with a very sarcastic sense of humor He sometimes is hard to understand but he does a very good job at making sure he is clear and understood at the end Entertaining class if you like it a little awkward 
No positive comments Went to class got made fun of by the professor for not understanding something The vast majority of the class seemed to be confused all the time I see all these reviews and would like to say they are  misleading and inaccurate If my rating is deleted then it is a giant cover up

Probably the worst professor Ive had at Tufts Unhelpful slides with pictures of cats difficult tests and he makes you spend for  for the workbook and online access code Talks down to most students who ask questions brags about his own research had an impress me project with no document specifying what the project was supposed to entail 
Class met twice a week and we had reading assignments and homework The reading assignments were just reading the textbook which you purchase online and we discussed the material in class Lectures went far more into the material than the reading and I felt that there was some disconnect between the homework and lectures But overall very good 
Enjoyable class I liked that Professor Ginsburg included some poetry and art so it wasnt just science I thought that livened things up Some of the lectures were dull but overall some truly mindblowing stuff 
I would describe him as condescending yet without the ability to teach His slides are an unfortunate attempt at humor which is disappointing because the topic of class the itself is intriguing

Idan is one of the least helpful professors Ive had As someone interested in astronomy but majoring elsewhere I expected to take a fairly straightforward basic course Instead I got a professor who was unable to explain basic concepts and tested us on our final worth  of grade with extremely difficult trick questions beyond course scope 
This really was a show up and pass type of course Readings and homework average to maybe  hours a week Material was super interesting Textbook has a crazy amount of information but honestly lectures were better Professor Ginsburg was approachable and nice Good course

Vesal really cares that students LEARN instead of rote memorize for exams Thought the class was really fair and feel ready for the MCAT and my future endeavors because of it Not too difficult either if you keep up with the problem sets and prelectures Make sure you go to class since test questions are really similar Would highly recommend

He is very enthusiastic about Physics However he is NOT a great professor He encourages higher level of physics thinking by quotreasoningquot out our confusions and talking through problems But he barely teaches in lecture and just talks alot Prepare to teach yourself everything and he is especially bad at teaching electromagnetism Tests are hard 
I will give Vesal credit that he actually tries to teach Physics but hes not a great professor as in when explaining concepts in class he sometimes confuses the class more than to begin with Additionally he will selectively answer questions on the Piazza page even if students have asked valid questions

GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK 
For someone that does not have a strong physics background Vesal makes it difficult to do well in the class He is stubborn about the way he teaches which makes it challenging for students who dont learn that way Ive had other flipped classrooms and his method is not helpful because his lectures consist of pollev questions without much teaching 
I do everything Vesal suggests to do well in the class and it still doesnt help He sits in class and stares at the board because he doesnt know how to answer his own questions Hes never straight up answered a question all semester from a student because half the time he doesnt know the answer himself

He needs to learn to communicate with his TAs He emphasizes concepts more than knowing formulas and on exams he wants us to express our confusion and ideas to get partial credit However the TAs ignore that and when you talk to him about it he doesnt do anything to change it so it becomes difficult to do well in the course

Vesal is probably my favorite teacher ever He cares so much its inspiring His classes are quotreversedquot and some people dont like that but some people do  characters are not enough to do this man justice but I am so grateful that I didnt just memorize equations I really learned and understood physics and I really appreciate him for that 
TOUGH GRADER 
Physics  and  with Vesal was definitely a challenge but as someone who just took the MCAT I felt so much more prepared for it then I would have been had I just memorized equations You definitely have to put effort into the class but if you put in the effort to really learn the content it will help a lot in other classesMCAT studying

Honestly I always thought though that Vesal might be more appreciated by physics majors who actually care about the subject rather than pre meds taking phy because they have to The flipped classroom thing and the emphasis on concepts rather than equations is slightly hard at times but with the right attitude its so rewarding and intresting

I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Dinis class even though I struggled through it His material was difficult because he made you think but if you went to office hours and met with him he often helped you think about the material really well The goal is to think deeply about the material and I was able to do well doing that

PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
People complain about flipped classroom but he genuinely believes in encouraging students to understand the concepts rather than memorizing formulas which is why he spends so much time on one problem If you go to office hours and make an effort he is very accessible and willing to help He is also responsive to feedback so just talk to him

Worst professor I have ever had at Tufts Take this class somewhere else 
Honestly  of the learning in this class is done outside of lecture Professor Dini is an amazing person but does not really teach Most of class is spent talking about one or two practice problems and most often the correct answer is never discussed He ultimately means well and truly cares that you learn physics but does not teach the material 
TEST HEAVY 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
Vesal cares about his students but doesnt teach any material at all we usually go over an average of two problems in class and people are always unsure of what the correct answer even is would not recommend at all not taking physics  here next semester just because of him 
Vesal is kind and caring but is one of the worst professors Ive ever had at Tufts His method of teaching is not conducive to learning and he always tells students to come to quothelp hoursquot but then doesnt show up or wont help unless more than a few people show up Lectures are a waste of time Vesal doesnt know how to answer his own questions

This is a flipped classroom which means lots of work and openended questions This can be challenging for students who are only used to solve questions with answer keys I study humanities but took PHY to learn how to think based on physical science and it did exactly that Plus Vesal allows you to make mistakes so long as you learn from them

Loved PHY  with Vesal Thought he did a great job with the reversed classroom Learned the concepts really well and didnt have to worry too much about math errors and tricky formulas Lots of easy ways to get points during the class Clearly cares more about learning than the grade 
Great professor Usually great math professors have great handwriting in south korea but his handwriting wasnt the neatest so I thought he was just whatever But he is actually amazing Listen to him and he teaches and stresses important stuff so students solve problems in such way that they dont make mistakes in exams Personally Math  was easy 
Lectures were organized and clear which is exactly what you need with these kind of math classes with a ton of sections He was very helpful outside of class and prepared us well for the exams 
Hes absolutely great I hated calculus and was able to really understand it and get a great grade from Jamie

Tests were way too difficult and made the material harder than it should have been Many students ended up withdrawing after the second midterm I highly recommend not taking him 
Wolf has a tough class to teach hard to make Calc interesting but he tries to be as clear as possible Best part about him is his availability to students Always takes the time to go over hw problems and waits after class to answer questions Dont be afraid of his office hours but go with specific questions from the hw

Horrible Professor and acts like he knows everything about anything Do not take him if you dont have to Exams are extremely difficult and looks to take off points for anything

best hardest most rewarding class I have ever taken Prof Hammer really wants his students to succeed very accessible explains it to you in crazy ways to help you understand easy to talk to about physics or life unconventional class but you ACTUALLY learn disliked by ppl who just want to use equations  not understand tough but worth it  
He does an awful job of explaining and hes very condescending Avoid if you can 
Hes from the Education Department but he knows his stuff His lecture style is hard to get use to but I feel like I learned physics and why things work the way they do He is SO extremely helpful outside of class as well Take Physics  with him 
Seems to want students to succeed but grading system seems set up almost to set up students to do poorly Lectures could be more clear and recitations leave more questions asked than answers explained 
Hammer makes himself very available to help and is genuinely concerned with students progress He stressed conceptual understanding over formula memorization on his exams which did frustrate some people There was a short video to watch for each class and a weekly problem set Overall a very good teacher with a difficult but rewarding class 
Hes one of the nicest professors Ive met here at Tufts Extremely accessible and stresses understanding the concepts above just memorizing formulas On the problem sets even if you get the question completely wrong hes more concerned with you being able to reason with your answer and being able to explain and critique your way of thinking 
Easiness Exams are curved to s with the average being a C The grading scheme is also bizarre Clarity Uh yeah Not much Interest level It WAS very high but not anymore Textbook Use Not existent Concepts are stressed more than math but much of the reasoning behind everything is lost without the mathematics component Very confusing 
Hammer is into physics education reform which is great but the execution of these changes is mostly unsuccessful Lectures and the notes are not insightful labs are graded completely haphazardly and the class as a whole doesnt prepare you for a thorough understanding of kinematics I agree with the previous poster about the condescending tone 
Professor Hollander is alright I took UEP  Intro to Urban Studies with him He is incredibly awkward but he knows his stuff I really respected him as a professor for the research hes done However he doesnt always use class time effectively and it seems like he doesnt take this class too seriously Generally easy grader

Teds creative writing class was one of the highlights of my semester He always starts the class off with interesting discussions and readings and the workshop process was so interesting and rewarding Plus he keeps his classes very small  people Ted is so kind and gives great feedback He helped me realize how much I love writing 
Great guy Had him for English  Love and Sexuality and had an awesome time Class became really close readings are short packets papers are interesting and fairly graded I always looked forward to this class and keep trying to get into his fiction class Definitely a must 
Weezner is the shiznit Everyone in the class got at least an A and passed out of English  Classes are very open and actually fun to go to We learn a lot about ourselves and others 
He is looking for something very specific in your creative writing and yet we never did any writing workshops on how to write good fiction He doesnt like other genres of writing like sci fi and if you try it he will penalize you He was also very unclear on what his grading scale was and so you never knew how you were doing in the class 
philosophy of emerson and thoreau was a great class and prof baz is a wonderful teacher He really pushes you to actually think and develop ideas instead of hiding behind the words of the writers you are reading 
Avner is amazing I am not one to talk about the joy of learning but Avner truly made it a wonderful experience He pays so much attention to students thoughts and takes them so seriously and lets students guide the class so muchits incredibly refreshing It was my first philosophy class and I now am into philosophy

One of the best classes I have take at Tufts Professor Baz is one of the best professors you can come across at Tufts Few  pages short papers and one  pages long paper Attend classes take notes make impression guaranteed AA 
Professor Baz is awesome Really interesting and smart guy who really cares about his students understanding of the material and strives for total comprehension The class is very driven by student questions but his insights into the material are thoroughly interesting He brought Emerson and Thoreau into a whole new light for me

Avner Baz is an intellectual force that sends chills down your spine from day  of Knowing and Being Extremely thought provoking discussions happen in this class and you learn how to articulate sound reasoning clearly Knowing the external world knowing other minds and knowing God are the three main topics tackled 
This was that one absolutely transformative class for me Definitely take this if youre interested in thinking about existence and experience in a really exciting way Baz is a fantastic lecturer and really tries to engage with you both in class and in office hours Tough but energizing class 
Class can be extremely boring as hr sessions is too long for overcrowd uninterested students While descartes is not the most fun topic he is a lively guy who makes for an enjoyable experience Strong resemblance to Borat 
He is very very into himself so he tends to act as though his opinion is better than everyone else That being said hes a great professor who tries to engage the class Can be a bit intimidating when it comes to grading but hes pretty fair It was a good class if you put enough effort in youll do well 
Dr Joseph is the worst professor I have ever had He has only contempt for his students He demands class participation but will likely dismiss what you have to say At the end of the course when we were to fill our reviews the TA literally tried to coordinate our efforts against him This no doubt is why he no longer teaches seminars 
He is a very smart guy but is pretty stuck up he told my class we were lucky to have him as a teacher He expects a lot out of his students but tries to keep them interested

Alfram is nice enough but he didnt know enough about the material and he had a habit of showing up to lecture at least  minutes late The worst thing about his lectures was that he would have no plan or content but was determined to make it last at least an hour Each lecture felt like it couldve been covered in an email

What a great experiencemy favorite course of the year at Tufts Unusual format no lectures we put topics and ideas on the board and then discuss them in class sometimes we divide up and argue the evidence as prosecutors or defense lawyers lots of opinion discussions in class Loved it 
What a great course everything about it was different than my other Tufts courses no textbook used his website discussions in every class lots of opportunity to express opinions and learned a lot about the US legal system at the same time He has a quirky sense of humor is an engaging speaker and very knowledgeable about the subject 
Loved his Famous US Trials classLOVED IT Im a psych major so this was not my area of study but it crossed so many fields law sociology history poli sci even psych I looked forward to it every weekfound myself wishing that class was more often Prof Pilarczyk is a rock star and I would definitely recommend taking a course with him 
I took Famous Trials in  should have rated it last year I very much enjoyed this class He alternated formats sometimes we divided into groups sometimes we took turns defending or prosecuting a case etc and facilitated active discussions It was never dull and I liked that it was never straight lectures One of my alltime favorites 
His Famous Trials in US History is one of my favorite courses in my academic career He is very engaging and keeps things interesting You learn a lot and the class is FUN No textbook required All reading is downloaded from a free website 
Hes not the easier professor he doesnt give extensions for example but he gives great feedback on all papers his class format is really unusual and works really well in fostering discussion and hes never boring Easily one of my favorite courses of all time 
This was my favorite class in four years at Tufts Although I dont have any particular interest in law his Famous Trials in US History class at the Ex College came highly recommended by a roommate who had taken it last year I loved it Law history sociology psychology popular culture all rolled into one Also loved the course materials

I took Prof Pilarczyks course at Tufts this past semester and it was one of my alltime favorites I dont mean favs of the semester or the year but of my entire  years Hes a rock star and I wish I could have taken more courses with him but he only teaches at Tufts every year or so BUs lucky to have him and so is Tufts when hes around 
Rullgard is very competent but has trouble explaining clearly to students how to do a problem giving the false impression that he doesnt know the material Does not encourage class participation at ALL didnt know students names by the end of the semester Knowledgeable for sure but not a great professor 
best professor ive come in contact with Very engaging and entertaining speaker with heavy focus on the real world Should be head of the Department 
He is amazingthe best econ prof i gave ever hadI had him for EC and now for EC He does not have a syllabus and we only use a textbook in EC but as long as you go to class and keep notes you are great He is a hard grader but you learn everything amazinglyAnd you learn about the real world and not only theory 
Great teacher He engages and stimulates a typically boring class Almost everyone whos taken a class with Prof Mosher RAVES about him 
Professor Mosher is truly an amazing teacher He actually made me wnat to go to class every day because it wasnt just stuff you could read out of any textbook he connected the class to the real world and brought something really amazing to it Its more thann any old econ course his class is unique 
Professor Mosher is the best professor in the Economics Department He makes the subject incredibly interesting to everyone The one common complaint is that he grades in a very subjective manner and does not use a syllabus Who Cares If you pay attention and want to learn you will do well I wish he taught more upper level courses 
He doesnt use a syllabus and reading assigmts arent checked No homework to be turned in no problem sets except he checks if you read stock market changes ie DOW JONES and the other biggies He was a little intimidating to me but hes a nice guy He often jokes with swears like F Harvard Info was too jumbled and confusing 
Awful prof Great guy that definitely knows his stuff but didnt have a syllabus or much of a plan for teaching Often ended class early because he had nothing left to say Tough grader Take EC  with someone else 
this class is a joke there is no textbook and there are hardly any readings  papers with the lowest grade dropped and  midterm exam and  final which was takehome the exams and papers are ridiculously easy but he grades them very harshly you probably learn  of what you would learn in another ec  section

Likes to let the students do most of the talking Its an interesting way to lead the class but I felt like we might have learned more if he was more proactive The essays were also a huge time commitment 
Very smart and approachable He met with each student for at least an hour to discuss essays He grades papers harshly though and its very hard to get an A from him 
Prof Phillips knows where hes leading the class into Hes very careful in teaching us the necessary philosophical skill while still letting us freedom to explore our interest Sometimes I feel that hes being too nice to the point that he doesnt want to dismiss anyones idea Hes really approachable I never talk to him for less than an hour 
Slow grader but very interesting in class to talk to Enjoyable 
Awful teacher and incredibly slow grader Do not take his course 
Given a chance Reid is really a great prof He really loves his stuff and no one in the Classics Department knows more than he does or frankly even comes close 
Greek  Roman comedy is a great class but as mentioned before it is hard to motivate yourself to go to class or do the readings Handouts explain a lot of what he covers and papersexams cover what is taught but are easier than expected 
I did not need to go to any of the classes or do much of the reading mostly because Im a Classics major and had already read much of what we were doing If you do  of the readings and know them well you will do great Easy grader but doesnt say much during class 
I am obsessed with Peter Reid Hes one of those professors youve always imagined having in college Old British tweed jacket Reids the man Hes an easy grader Although sometimes boring an unfocussed I suggest you go to class to get the handouts they summarize ALL the material and to hear stories about his life hes done everything

Lectures were not all that helpful  I found that using the online resources for the class and looking up videos online helped me learn the material more Levine is definitely more helpfulclear in office hours than in class 
He doesnt use a textbook so you need to take his word on everything The problem is he doesnt follow his own guidelines Hell tell you that you need to do something one way not another then hell do it the second way and take points off if you do it the way he told you If you take this class explain everything you do Good luck 
Literally reads you power points that he didnt even create Super awkward when you have to ask him a question about them because he rarely knows the answer 
Dont torture yourself though this class if you dont have to He doesnt explain things well and doesnt use a textbook On a positive note he is always available outside of class even if its not his office hours

Interesting material terrible teacher McPherson makes no room for students just asserts his interpretation of the articles as absolute Even if you have textual evidence for a point he wont listen He doesnt help explore the material and is ridiculously dismissive of respected philosophers Dont bother to ask questions he wont listen

worthless lectures 
All  courses tied in to each other in a way so if youve had one youve got a really good idea about the others Most notes are online and therefore you dont need to go to class much

A legend in the field His lectures might not be super shiny but he is  of the top minds in the field of HCI and listening to him is inspirational Hes accessible and gives amazing advice 
Super boring guy Scattered lectures Very nice though Youll learn how to make a GUI but its mostly copypasting his example code and modifying it 
Clearly knowledgeable but cant teach his way out of a paper bag Assignments are trivial or impossible Goes over material on assignments after assignment is due Textbook is useless and out of date Avoid if you dont already know Java well 
Do NOT buy the textbook for any of his classes When you ask him questions directly he will clarify things for you but in class his lectures are a little more scattered and the overall course seems to lack a clear direction You will definitely get better in programming but you have to work really hard on the assignments which are quite long 
I thought he was helpful 
GROUP PROJECTS 
This class was incredibly easy most people didnt show up to many of the lecture Hes a super nice guy but a lot of the lectures were on outdated material and he didnt engage the class well at all 
You dont get much from the lectures You learn from the assignments though 
Best professor Ive ever had will do anything for his students You get the most from his classes if you are really into learning what he teaches if you arent then it is easy to slide through 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
I didnt quite like his teaching style I was told that his class was very easy but when I took the class I was bored out of my mind and could not follow along in class He spends the entire class going over examples of things that we will have to do for our assignments This may help some but for me this was an issue because I didnt know Java

Rob is a very smart individual He puts a large focus on learning matlab Most homework will require at least a little bit of matlab to solve Many of his homework assignments are difficult but they mostly are based on solving real engineering problems 
Great professor very smart guy Very clear presentations straightforward labs fair homework and fair tests Available outside of class and via email although responses can be slow Take this class with him if you have the option 
take a class with white if you can

Chris is a great professor He takes a very dry class and makes it enjoyable He really focuses on making sure everyone has the concepts He does not put a lot of focus on actually doing calculations but rather having an intuition towards fluid mechanics 
Took ES ME  and ME and worked in the Lab Great Professor Classes are tough but interesting Has very loyal and competent TAs and Grad Students 
Insanely eccentrichyper teacher GOOD Clear presentations encourages demands class involvement Uses stories to supplement lessons BAD Lots of work horrible text mandatory attendance unpredictable tests 
Chris is by far my favorite teacher at Tufts He is so enthusiastic about what he teaches and is incredibly knowledgable and resourceful in everything he teaches I have just signed up for my third class with him because I truly enjoy going to his classes

Professor Roberts is a great professor He is also insanely knowledgeable about what he teaches Discussing people involved in Egyptian history during class he would often say he had met these people and talk about them and their personalities He is an extremely qualified professor and I would recommend taking a class with him 
Prof Roberts is brilliant has a wealth of knowledge about anything to do with the Middle East and North Africa and will be able to answer your questions He has a wonderfully dry sense of humor Sometimes class can drag though 
Professor Roberts is incredibly knowledgeable Every class he just spews information sometimes so much that it is difficult to write it all down While class can seem long and boring you still learn a lot Dr Roberts is also really kind and understanding I definitely recommend this class especially if you know little on the subject 
Hugh Roberts is definitely one of the most brilliant professors Ive had at Tufts Hes one of the worlds foremost experts on Algeria and North Africa and this sometimes causes his lectures to go beyond the level of comprehension of the class Even so hes available and eager to talk and the class only had a midterm final and term essay 
An authority on the Middle East and North Africa Incredible depth of understanding of the historical facts and issues at play For Middle East and North Africa since WWI there was two tests and a paper Very fair grading The lectures are so informative the readings almost seem supplemental

Prof Roberts has a vast knowledge of his subject and it shows in his lectures They can occasionally drag but the class is worth taking if youre pursuing history as a major or simply looking for credit There are only three graded assignments so work isnt too heavy However he makes you sign up for recitations which are mandatory 
Roberts knows tons about his subject material Tests are take home and are not graded difficultly if effort and research are introduced Interesting survey history course and highly recommended 
Prof Roberts is an extremely smart guy no doubt but lectures become very boring quickly Mandatory recitation actually quite helpful though Exams are takehome and only one term paper so definitely recommend if you need to fulfill a humanities andor Middle Eastern culture course

Suuuuuch a G All the reading was suggested and really easy to do Class discussions were super intriguing He is clearly so passionate about what he teaches and loves challenging students to think about things different or more in depth We had zero mandatory homework and only  papers due  ungraded and  graded Gives super good feedback 
White is able to explain the most complex concepts clearly to students with no experience in the subject but also encourages students to deeply pursue their own interests and always has a wealth of resources available Best professor at Tufts hands down 
Professor White is my favorite professor at Tufts hands down He is clearly so passionate about what he teaches and he is so excited to hear what his students have to say and what suggestions they have for class material Every philosophy major should take a class with him His class discussions are wonderful 
Philosophy of Mind  I was in way over my head in this course I had only taken Intro to Philosophy before this course and I was completely unprepared Dr White was great entertaining and liked to take things slow and let us all absorb the material Be warned that you will have to pretty much make your own path in the class 
If you are not a philosophy major or even if you are you MUST ask tons of questions to follow all the arguments There are plenty of allusions to things you havent read so make sure he knows you havent read those arguments Force White to go through them in some acceptable level of detail before he loses you Otherwise great class 
i got an aand its on my frigethanks mr w 
Whites lectures  philosophy as therapy Instead of cramming as much reading into a course as possible he encouraged us to think and write 
If you take this course or any other upper level Philosophy without a firm background in Aristotle Descartes and Semantics than you are screwed I was screwed So what White is the man By far one of the best lectureres at Tufts Incredible His grasped of the material is unparelled loves his work and hist students All around great philosher

Proctor classes are the easiest As you will ever find You dont even have to attend lecture to do well in the class For the exams you essentially just regurgitate Proctors lecture notes which he shares with you before the exam On top of that he gives you plenty of extra credit opportunities like his movie nights 
Prof Malchow is very knowledgeable and although his lectures are very monotone and sometimes boring he can be very helpful if you make an effort to connect with him Not that difficult a grader and I didnt go to class all the time 
I took Rebel Rebel with him I never imagined such an interesting sounding class could be so unbearably boring His lectures were horrible and of very little interest despite the subject matter and he doesnt seem at all invested in his students 
his lecture are dry but he makes a lot of effort to help his students hes the only professor ive had to invite the class over for dinner and he has helped me out greatly  years after i took a course with him tufts needs more professors like malchow

Overall his lectures are boring and stale He doesnt take attendance and you dont really have to show up to class I didnt do any of the reading and it was fine The only thing I was scared about was the midterm because it is closed book only assignment that is but he gave us all the prompts ahead of time 
he is a good hearted person even if ocassionally he seems like hes not so interested in the classes for instance he scheduled out of class meetings many times with everyone in the class at the end of the semester he had us over for dinner

Malchow is fine Lectures are boring and you wont learn anything but it is all take home papers and exams You just have to write them and you will easily get B to A range Doesnt matter if you do the reading or just backwards read to write essays But overall hes fine Not hard 
This professor is easily one of the most pretentious and narcissistic individuals i have met during my time at Tufts He talks down to students is ridiculously unclear about what he expects in assignments and is not accessible at all Do not take a class with this professor unless you absolutely have to 
IR the Historical Perspective Prof Malchow is a very dry and boring lecturerincredibly hard to pay attention to He never encouraged class participation there were also only two exams and an optional essay there were readings but no incentive to do them except for exams This was the worst Tufts IR course I have ever taken STAY FAR AWAY

If this is your first ever calc class run away Just has so many confusing lectures 
I had Prof McNinch for the second semester of abstract algebra Coming off a very crisp lecturer in the first semester Prof McNinch was hard to get used to at first because he can be a bit mumbly After a few classes however I got used to it and found that I learned a lot from those mumbles He is great in office hours too 
Stay away Unprepared unclear and unorganized Take other professors if you can you wont regret it 
I enjoyed taking this first undergrad abstract algebra class with Prof McNinch His lecture style was rigorous which I like yet downtoearth An interested student who keeps up with reading the lectures and homework should learn a lot of abstract algebra and do well I hope to take other classes with him 
LECTURE HEAVY 
He kinda rambles a lot but if you read the boo you should be fine He is good about providing test prep material so even if his lectures dont make sense he gives enough worked through examples that you can understand the material 
McNinch is a nice enough person but isnt used to teaching lower level math classes so he would often overwork problems He is accessible but you might consider someone like Kim Ruane instead 
TEST HEAVY 
LECTURE HEAVY 
If youve never taken a calc class before dont take McNinchs class If you took AP calc in high school AB or BC and did well you will do just fine in his class His lectures can be confusing for people learning calc for the first time He rambles and mumbles a lot His lecture slides also have lots of typos He also goes through slides fast 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
TOUGH GRADER 
Professor McNinchs lectures are very dry and scattered Its basically more helpful to teach yourself the material from the textbook than to go to lecture However he does provide good review material for exams but he asks you to be very specific on the exams I would recommend trying to get a better lecturer if you are taking linear 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
I went into Linear Algebra this past semester having not taken Calc  so I felt slightly under prepared compared to everyone else Besides that I did not feel like McNinch was the best person to teach this class He was a very nice guy and you could tell that he wanted his students to do well but he had difficulty conveying his knowledge 
Tough teacher A bit confusing Went for office hours but was still left confused 
UC is one of the worst and most frustrating professors Ive ever had He gets confused when teaching concepts that seem basic and is usually unable to answer students questions in any meaningful or useful way He does not write his own lecture slides or tests but the tests are easy since questions are pulled directly from the homework 
Horrible professor only redeeming quality is how easy he is Seems bored with class because it is an intro course 
TEST HEAVY

GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
UC was a hilarious guy but didnt really teach us economics EC is supposed to be an intro level class but without prior econ experience you will be completely lost HIs lectures often were just a long ramble about a nonecon related topic that didnt hold my attention Great guy okay professor

Ive never written a review before but I felt the need to bc these reviews do not do UC justice he is a very good professor that structures the class based on the students interests he is very knowledgeable on a lot of topics he is witty and keeps the class interesting btw you are graded on very few things but if you study youll be fine 
I was in Professor Chakravortys first class at Tufts He was not exceptionally passionate about teaching economics nor did he liven up the class with personal storiesexperience I would advise against taking a class with him if you can manage it 
Chakra is a undeniably a great guy Hes always in high spirits and is a pleasure to listen to However he did not seem to have any structure to his lectures He often got off track and he did not do a good job teaching the material 
AMAZING LECTURES

Class is not necessarily easy but Professor Chakravorty is probably the most lenient grader there is Such a friendly guy and great at explaining concept if you are interested enough to pay attention 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
He puts in a lot of effort to teaching and designing syllabi but I really dont like his lectures I feel like they dont set you up to tackle the homework at all Recitations are good Theres a ludicrous amount of homework Would not take another class with his teaching it He does make a lot of effort though so I have to give him credit there 
The rumors are true take Comp  and eventually your friends will stop calling to see if you want to hang out You learn a ton it eats your life and youll develop a lovehate relationship with Ramsey within the first week He doesnt have a good handle on how much smarter than everyone he is How do you put a number on that 
Great class Teaches programming all around 
I have not learned as much as I learned in Professor Ramseys onesemester class in any other class I have taken at Tufts Yes his class was definitely hard but my programming ability improved fold easily Professor Ramsey is also INCREDIBLY helpful available via Skype AIM even home phone

Greatest professor Ive ever had Take the class but be ready to work really hard You finish the class being a great programmer Norman is really passionate about Programming Languages I would take the class again and again with Norman 
Quite possibly the most difficult course Ive ever taken However you learn an incredible amount and if you are up for the challenging assignments and breadth of knowledge to be consumed it is worth the struggle Ramsey has high expectations often causing strain but he is very helpful to compensate

This class requires more work than any other computer science course at Tufts and most of it will be tedious busy work Norman is a terrible lecturer who likes to focus on his academic prowess rather than actually teaching students All CS majors are unfortunately required to take this course but if possible take it with a different professor 
The worst class I have ever taken at Tufts I LOVE programming I enjoy challenging work but Ramsey destroyed Comp with incoherent lectures and insane assignments STAY AWAY 
You may be coding on a bus during the holiday for his class but you will learn a crazy lot of things He has a strong personality and really cares about the students No other professors will still be posting resources a month after the class has ended TAKE HIS COURSE 
Prof Ramsey is awesome He knows his stuff too well but he clearly tries his best to bring his knowledge down to the level of the beginners like us His explanation of concepts are really clear He cares so much about our own learning After the course my programming skill improves so much 
This is the hardest class you will ever take in your life but Norman is THE BEST PROFESSOR YOU WILL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE He cares so much about his students and teaches you an impossible amount in one semester 
Quite possibly one of the most timeconsuming courses at Tufts Even though the projects at time seem absurd you end up learning a ton Professor Ramsey is extremely helpful and puts forth an admirable amount of time to his students Be sure to read the assignments carefully before beginning them

The title of this course may be a bit misleading but nonetheless Nick tries to make the material palatable Some of his explanations lack depth and lead to transgressions making class discussions feel like they are constantly bouncing around He is intelligent no doubt but he sadly doesnt adequately impart this knowledge on his students  
Youre pretty much on your own for this class because he doesnt give you any grades until the end On the one hand thats a bad thing because you cant be certain as to how well youre doing but on the other you learn to put your heart into what youre writing The course was definitely worth taking though classes could be boring occasionally

Possibly the best professor at Tufts I took his class first semester freshman year and learned more there than anywhere else A lot of reading and inclass discussion of texts You can get away with not doing the reading but you really miss out He gives amazing feedback on essays and though its easy to get a B hes hard to impress Worth it

Hirata is brilliant well connected in the field and works with other famous professors Took him for JPN Japan and Postmodernism He gives great paper feedback and is very clear He makes a challenging topic lovable Expect an intelligent quirky yet downtoearth kind of guy Hes presumptuous like all philosophers 
Simply the best professor Ive ever had Bruce Hitchner can make any topic in the world fascinating to listen to for any amount of time Furthermore he is an awesome guy and is very helpful with whatever you need His large courses are excellent but Id suggest taking a small class with him if you ever get the chance hes fantastic 
Hitchers class is interesting and fairly easy The class was a large lecture and recitation sections with a TA There were three tests blue book essay IDs which were easy  helped if you were a good writer The reading is not necessary except for two page papers due every week in recitation very easy and not graded hard 
Fantastic professor Great with lectures and knows the material very well Highly recommended Im planning on taking more classes with him and Ive told my friends to do the same 
Hitchner is a good professor Lectures can get kinda boring it IS a history class Grading is extremely fair because your TA grades the exams but then Hitchner regrades them all to make sure everything is fair I would take another class with him He is a little intimidating but he seems like a nice guy 
History of Rome  This is exactly what youd expect from this class Its a history class so lectures will be a little boring The grading was very fair because the TAs grade the tests and he regrades them all to make sure everything is as it should be usually to the students benefit If you like Rome or history this class is fine 
INSPIRATIONAL

Absolutely amazing professor I had him for History of Ancient Rome as well as a Lecturer in a traveling seminar and he really brought the history to life He is passionate about what he teaches and if you care about the subject he would like you There are only a few papers and maybe a project so not too overwhelming Great course overall 
Absolutely brilliant Highly recommend taking a class from him Really could not have been better Great guy as well

Very interesting lecturer definitely knows a lot about the subject 
Good professor knows almost everything there is to know about the roman world 
Excellent teacher if you can get past his inherent geekness Easily one of the most brilliant minds on campus 
Couchs enthusiasm is infectious like a glorious disease Except good for you Seriously though hes very fair if difficult and very willing to help anyone out with any problems Assignments are very wellrelated to material and exams are actually relevant a rarity in comp sci exams 
Excellent professor Couch obviously understands Computer Science extremely well and can also explain the difficult topics so the class can understand His armpits always seem to be swetty though 
Can solidly say that Couch is the worst professor Ive had while at Tufts He is incredibly unclear and disorganized and leaves students to sort through a mess of halfthoughts while ignoring clarifying questions He is definitely excited about what he is teaching but has little ability to get past that excitement in sharing with students 
Enormously hard but genuinely enthusiastic about the subject and students understanding of it 
CARING 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
Professor Couchs lecture style is disorganized and confusing Regularly goes off on tangents goes way too far indepth on some things and not enough on others Very unclear about assignments and nuances of the subject matter At the same time incredibly caring gives extensions grades fairly and willing to help Read the book 
He is wonderfully enthusiastic and knowledgable but assignments are hard and exams are even more difficult However you actually learn new things from his classes and get what you paid for in Tufts tuition 
Exceptional teacher Assignments are challenging yet interesting and rewarding His tests were very hard and only a true mastery of the class concepts will net an A However its still possible to do well in the course through dilligence on assignments and extracredit I highly recommend Couch if you want to learn and get your moneys worth 
Good teacher Loves the subject matter Cares about the students A bit absentminded 
Ive taken virtually every class hes taught at Tufts and hes a great professor Sometimes a little strange but always willing to help Exams and projects are challenging as they should be in this field 
Excellent professor Gives helpful examples and explains topics well really knows the material Always willing to help on assignments which tend to be fairly hard and answer questions in class Tests arent too bad labs quizzes and projects always have extra credit Kind of a weird guy  laughs at almost nothing probably a dozen times a class 
fantastically energetic possessed of expert knowledge creative genuinely concerned helpful and personally involved in the education of a class with over  students dont expect easy assignments 
Fantastic teacher Really the only practical teacher in Tufts CS that really teaches you Ridiculous amount of material covered but youll know Linux and lots of hardware specifics pretty well at the end Dont take this class if you dont like low level C and OS in general though unless its required of course for us COMP Es 
Best professor ever 
Awesome awesome awesome 
I was an EE major way back in  and took this course when it was called Data Structures in C He was fantastic then and as I understand fantastic now His projects were very difficult and molded my skill set to compete anyone The tools learned have provided a solid foundation throughout my career Dr Couch is THE best 
One of the best professors I have ever had Very demanding but great sense of humor He cares deeply about students and hes really hot too 
Freshmen who have not taken Economics in high school beware he teaches what should be simple concepts at a very difficult level If you need or want to take this class take it second semester with Norman 
very dry jokes I completely agree that he asks questions that require math well above the level that is a prerec for this course There were group finals and midterms that were very difficult because they are all take homes and to be done in groups Take the class with norman in the fall he has a more normal system and hes helpful 
Adds his dry sense of humor into the lecures 
Hes passionate about the subject but his teaching style is confusing and he can be disorganized  hurt me particularly when he suddenly changed the due date of a problem set to an earlier time without any notice and I hadnt planned for it I asked for accommodation and he simply acknowledged my request and did nothing My grade was screwed 
i love his drinking jokes and Bacows fetish jokes too his lectures are straight on target no bulls he has this annoying thing he puts stuff that he didnt teach on the problem sets and teaches the crp after the problem sets are handed in good TAs though yay Francis 
worst econ prof in the department 
Solid lectures funny guy fair About all you can ask for 
Despite sometimes boring lectures kept class interested and delivered difficult material pretty clearly Great course great professor 
Not a bad lecturer does a good job of keeping the class engaged and explaining the material with interesting examples and clear concise powerpoints to take notes from His problem sets and tests often contain topics not covered in class and are always feindishly difficult 
did not find him helpful at all he did not seem to care about his students or how they were doing in his class would not recommend him 
Amazing Richards makes you learn acvanced microeconomics thats super difficult but then shows you how to use it for realworld stuff like estimating profits from the lysine cartel or when mergers will happen He puts tons of work into helping with our papers too Hes the best prof in Tufts ec 
I had problems staying awake in class but when I was awake he was funnybut he curves down for final grades I had an A with a  
ok 
good engaging lecturer not very approachable outside of class so you have to count on the TAs quite a bit for help tests and problem sets were hard but he knew this so final was much much easier 
He does a fantastic job of teaching very difficult material Grade is completely based on  exams which are open book and open note but are very difficult Interesting subject matter and taught pretty well 
Class moves slow and is really easy but professor is hillarious and makes class interesting 
relates econ to real life charismatic passionate about the subject curved up some grades at the end i believe open bookopen notes exams but still very difficult 
Richards lectures become extremely confusing towards the end of the year when more difficult concepts are introduced He does a poor job of explaining theory and instead throws up abstract notes with no indication of how to use them His problems sets are much more difficult than the tests and you never even use the book Find another prof 
Simple and Straightforward just Ec 
Entertaining and educational class Richards is thorough and helpful if you seek it out I saw him during office hours and he responded to a question i had via email in less than  min This class made me choose econ as my major Be ready to work prob sets are not easy but very applicable to real lifeFind extra help like ARC tutor or TAs 
Dan Richards did an exceptionally bad job of teaching intro to micro Tests did not reflect how well one knew the material and were unnecessarily tricky when he had no right to make them so considering the simplicity of his lectures the difficulty of his problem sets and the uselessness of the tex 
TAs are terrible but pale in comparisson to Richards uselessness Hes not what I would call approachable Youll drop  on a book that is utterly worthless Find a tutor and you should be alright Its up to you to learn it on your own which you know isnt that difficult but thats not why Tufts cuts this guy a check every week though 
Richards is mediocre In EC he was OK In EC he is unacceptable The problem sets are riddled with mistakes which seriously impede comprehension of the material Exams are hard and not really fair you can study for a week straight and not do any better on the exam than somebody who studies the night before Richards is unhelpful 
Absolute musthave for Quant Macro He has his own bizarre brand of humor that keeps dry course material interesting Hes also just a talented Economist hell teach you how to think like one if you let him 
Heres the truth Richards believes in sink or swim he wont offer any extra help believe me Ive sat outside his office during office hours as he talked politics with a friend his lectures are so brief that its up to you to extrat what he means for yourself Dont buy the book he doesnt care Psets are so hard and doesnt relate to course 
Bad professor He tries note word quottriesquot to be funny at the expense of clarity Impossible to track down outside of classnearly ended up with incomplete after becoming sick before finals bc he didnt respond to me Difficult problem sets on material thats not taught until the day after its due Good TAs though Dont count on help from him 
Richards is an intelligent person but shouldnt teach an intro class He had difficulty simplifying concepts and his powerpoints were often incomprehensible He also included material from EC  or higher and was not in our textbook The exams were take home but still hard I did well in the class but had to teach myself from the textbook 
GREAT 
A solid lecturer decent sense of humor but extremely poor organization makes his class frustrating still i learned a lot 
really bad 
Richards is a wonderful and entertaining teacher He can get slightly confusing at times but generally wont mind talking to you just after class THe only problem is that his exams are really hard BUt he makes the subject so interesting and you really feel like you learn sth Def worth having as a teacher 
teaches macro stuff in microecon 
Smart man but he repeats a lot 
Clearly very smart but his lectures are hard to follow The tests arent too bad but Id have rather taken it with another professor 
I took Quant Macro with him The class was kind of crazy no work no textbook open notes test the final was a group take home The class was very difficult still He kept EXTREMELY dry topics interesting The only problem was that he used a lot of math that wasnt part of any prequesite classes 
Id heard many bad things about Dan Richards prior to taking the class mostly centered on how hard his class was My fears were unfounded Lecture can get a tad tedious but his slides are very clear he moves through the material fairly slowly and he has extra review sessions before exams which themselves are only moderately hard 
Terrible Professor and barely teachers 
Extremely funny  makes economics easy to understand and envokes enthusiasm 
People with no prior exposure to economics had a lot of trouble in this class But hes a pretty fair ie easy grader He really knows his stuff and is an enjoyable professor Great sense of humor 
definitely a FOX 
His heart is in the right place Seems totally unused to teaching Intro made the topics far more complicated than they should be and used math ie calculus beyond the prerecs for the course Also his exams and to a lesser extent the psets were at a much higher level than anything we learned in class Very disappointing 
Dan Richards was the worst teacher I have ever had He is generally ignorant and his tests dont reflect a general knowledge of the course material Also I would like to debunk the myth that Richards is funny  
he taught the material on problems sets the day AFTER they were due tests sucked only did well because of goood TAs pretty uninterestin differ with the book on how to do problems making it difficult to learn 
Good guy makes you laugh even in Econ lecture Fair and predictable Light work load and bearable tests 
Professor Richards teaches a very entertaining class I think most students who have trouble in the class skip the recitations which is very tempting and therefore dont see or do the practice problems The TAs go over pretty much anything youll face in the recitations Since I started going to recitations everything is clear 
His powerpoint presentations are really helpful and clear He explains the information well Also he makes a lot of jokes about being an but in a funny way Definitly a good guy 
Just had my stever exam with Dan Richards What a challenge Openbook and notes but he still found a way to make it new    and tough Hes the st prof Ive had who really makes you think Im lovin it 
Overall he is a decent professor The book isnt great but the material is not overly complicated The biggest problem is that he doesnt teach all of the information needed to complete the problem sets until the last day or two before it is due Argh Other than that not a bad class 
He kept me awake was a good presenter and was not too tough a grader He liked making jokes which were often about booze Plus the hat he wears around campus is pretty admirable 
EXTRA CREDIT 
TOUGH GRADER 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
He is not very helpful or clear but maybe that is because this was his first time ever teaching a class as he is a graduate student If you can get past the lack of clarity and awkwardness you will learn things 
Hes a really great guy who cares about his students He is really passionate about the material and tries hard to make it fun A really fun class with field trips and plants collecting and you learn a lot through presentations and panels He is not harsh and gets that students have a lot of work Would recommend 
He is simply one of the best professors I have ever met in my life Very unique Sort of funny I highly recommend attending his course 
Does not care about his students at all Grades seem random and unfairly harsh he is extremely difficult to understand in class and is not impressively knowledgable about material even when meeting one on one Tufts econ department is just so bad

In the beginning I thought his lectures were snoozy but once I started paying attention it all made sense Hes actually really funny and wants his students to do well Hes really helpful in office hours too 
he is okay assignments are not clear garman is a better econometrics prof 
You cant read his notes on the overhead because he stands in the way His attempts at explaining dont help which was okay since he didnt expect us to learn anything 
The class is a joke because he doesnt know how to teach Assignments are easy but not always clear and grades seem arbitrary 
Not sure why this guy takes so much flack on these message boards Hes actually a good professor who is rather lenient in his grading I liked him because he teaches the class around the main concepts of the subject rather than plowing through every chapter in the book Take his class if you can 
Hes fairly clear with his lectures However unlike all the other ratings this is a summer course for stats His exams are either hard or easy and he grade somewhat subjectively 
Hands down the worst professor Ive ever had He is incredibly hard to understand and his notes and lectures are simply appalling When I showed up to office hours he made it painfully obvious he had better things to do His tests do not adequately reflect the material Tufts should be embarrassed to have hired this man AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS

One of the most inspirational people Ive ever met Extremely knowledgable patient helpful and comical Lemelin is the perfect professor of Russian He goes to great lengths to support his students progress and develop their love of Russian language and culture 
LITERALLY the most amazing professor I have had through my entire academic career He is charismatic beyond intelligent and extremely engaging He is a phenomenal speaker and super nice although he can be intimidating at first The course is hard but I found myself looking forward to class and enjoying every assignment A MUST take class 
As a senior who has taken a lot of classes at Tufts I can say that no one has impressed me more No one knows more about theory or film And hes sexy too 
When the postmodernism and film class burst into applause after Edelmans final lecture I knew that they appreciated as much as I did the brilliance and enthusiasm he brought to every class Hes one of three profs at Tufts youve GOT to take 
The highlight of my academic career This professor is simply the most rigorous committed and fantastic pedagogue I have ever met I cannot recommend him highly enough 
How this professor can talk with such eloquence and humor and intelligence WITHOUT USING ANY NOTES is beyond me The best lecturer youll ever hear And hot 
He will provide you with answers to his questions early on in the semester and a vocab to use and then the rest of your time will be wasted inflating his large ego Terrible terrible teacher operating under the guise of a cunning speaker so was Hitler

Edelmans nice and caring but his class is not structured well The texts assigned are very heavy and require long discussions for someone to fully comprehend it but he barely mentions them in class Also even though he is a good lecturer its sometimes difficult to take notes as he is a fast talker Not the best English prof 
Without a doubt the most articulate person I have ever known Postmodernism is a hard class to get an A in but definitely worth it if only because you get an opportunity analyze fairly popular movies through a completely new lens Edelman is an amazing lecturer although the content can be overwhelming at times Overall a fantastic course

I had Professor Edelman for Hitchcock Gender Cinema Ideology This was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Tufts Professor Edelman is a really great lecturer and is super engaging He allows students even in a fairly big lecture to get an opportunity to participate and is very responsive and receptive to students answers 
If you cant understand his point of view youre obviously missing a lot of important stuff in life This guy digs deep into everything and challenges our societys simple explanations HIGHLY recommend his classesif youre intelligent enough 
Pompous and pretentious hearing him try to speak French is almost worth taking his class  ALMOST and an idiot who loves his own voix On the Gospel according to Edelman never have I been a party to such an awful case of the Emperors New Clothes 
the most sophisticated theorist at Tufts 
Professor Edelman is incredibly intelligent wellspoken and full of fascinating insight especially in regard to Hitchcock films He is however rather intimidating and although probably really appraochableits scary to make that first step 
Possibly one of the most intelligent people ive ever met You dont have to agree with him to enjoy his extremely well crafted lectures He will always explain it again if asked Extremely hard to get an A but an absolutely wonderful experience 
Possibly the single most brilliant man Ive ever met  certainly the most eloquent His lectures are almost emotionally moving Hes also quite funny and as my prof advisor and chair of department he is extremely helpful every time I seek him out but he will not hunt you down which may be good or bad for you depending The work is worth it 
A class with him is worth the extra time youll have to put into it As other people have noted his lectures are amazing He is not pretentious just incredibly well spokenwhich can put some people off If you ever need help Prof Edelman is extremely approachable and listens with an open ear You will not regret the experience 
Incredibly selfenamored and carried away with his own cleverness His lectures are flashy but low on content 
Every class was a masterful performance Amazing energy passion and insight Its intellectual nectar for those who care more about rigorous thought than an easy grade 
I agree Wasted my time 
Edelman is a bro He is clear poignant concise intriguing and insurmountably intelligent His lectures dont disappoint and you will undoubtedly learn so much from this class I dont care if youre a film major or an engineer this class is enlightening and definitely worth taking The grading is nowhere near easy but its worth it

RESPECTED 
AMAZING LECTURES 
HILARIOUS 
Best professor ive ever had an absolute genius take hitchcock even if you dont care about film that much  it will blow your mind edelmans lectures are the best ive ever heard and he is very passionate about the subject matter 
He takes the material and the students in his classes seriously and puts on a hell of a show Hes amazing 
This guy is a suckah But man is he one hot chili 
Amazing amazing amazing He will change your perspective of the world People who are convinced that their ideas are always right should steer clear though The best professor I know 
The best public speaker I have ever heard in person read seen in film or on tape living or dead Lectures as if he practiced ever word and gesture in a mirror yet answers off the cuff questions with the same errorless form even quoting whole sections of texts Uses no notes Possibly an alien Intimidating yet always pleasant polite and fair The only teacher Ive had at Tufts who was worth the price of admission Only class where I couldnt have learned more in  minutes on wikipedia

English majors think that the class is not a wellstructured English class and film majors think that its not a wellstructured film class Either way its a loselose situation Im an English major and I find this class more challenging and less insightful and analytical than the seminars Ive taken 
His classes were the education I dreamed of and most needed Not for the faint of heart Definitely for those that are after it 
Great classbrilliant speaker tons of funand biceps

AMAZING LECTURES 
Incredibly articulate intelligent and charismatic But beware do not EVER skip class as there is no textbook or any kind of reference except what he says in lectures He talks fast and its often hard to take notes bc the content is so dense You should be fine if you pay close attention watch all the movies and review with other students 
Bad 
Very into himself wanders away from actual material and into the realm of his own pretentious head often Hes an  and actually and will shut down people who talk and present things differently than he does Actually saw him recall something incorrectly while shutting down a student and then never apologized pretty weak stay away 
Good luck He successfully made me dread comp sci and detest going to class I feel depressed every time after going to his class  he cant help using terminology that no one is familiar with and goes off tangent to talk about stuff that are not important at all He usually waste the first  minutes talking about trivial stuffs

Sheldon is honestly the worst professor I have ever had in my entire life  His lectures and curriculum are extremely disorganized and unclear  He responds to questions in either long offtopic paragraphs or rudely tells you to find it out yourself  He assigns random projects that are at a much higher level than the current curriculum 
INSPIRATIONAL 
HILARIOUS 
I liked him but I can definitely see why some people wouldnt  hes very passionate about comp but often goes on tangents which are entertaining but not always related to that class If youre love comp youll probably enjoy him if you enjoy laid back profs if youre gonna take this class and never touch comp again try someone else 
The entire course was a mess He had horrible organizational skills and didnt manage the TAs well Mark and the TAs didnt seem to care for anything but to make this course the tough course Some funny jokes here and there but those were never relevant or encouraging

Professor Sheldon knows his stuff and hes good at covering the data structures indepth in interesting ways to help you remember One thing though is that we tended to spend heavy amounts of time on some data structures and much less on others Labs are good and fair and homeworks are phenomenally helpful for cementing knowledge

Class is run on autopilot with minimal input from Mark Lectures are not very helpful  relied on TAs to fill in the blanks Take it for the HWs and try to find good partners to pair with 
LECTURE HEAVY 
GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK 
Some lectures were more useful than others Homework was always relevant and useful as were projects His sense of humor may be hit or miss but his approach to the material tended to make perfect sense Responded well to student feedback and would make adjustments if students seemed to be in over their heads with an assignment 
Class is completely unrelated to projects but still interesting if you can pay attention Sheldon does a really great job with such a difficult class Only downside is that he didnt design the class so he doesnt have a firm understanding of the projects Use the TAs 
He provides a great foundation from which you can learn more about CS His assignments challenge students ultimately creating an excellent learning experience Plenty of help is provided through him personally as well as through TAs but only if you ask for it 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
TOUGH GRADER 
His class was awful and the he did nothing to help that His lectures were unclear and the homework criteria exceedingly vague and youd pretty much be graded on interpretation because of that He thinks hes right all the time when grading  getting points back on assignments is tough I dunno if I will continue CS because of his class 
Sheldon is a pretty good professor He can be a bit vague and his hw specs can be a bit vague as well but he lets you have a cheat sheet for exams and he is receptive during office hours Comp has been pretty breezy this semester and I think its because Sheldon gave me a good base in Comp

TAs are your most helpful resource in this class Otherwise Mark is a lot better oneonone during office hours You can skip lectures and still do well

He has ruined my life and made me depressed I transferred out of Tufts because of him He crushed whatever happiness I had and now Im ready to end it all 
Hes easily the most enthusiastic lecturer Ive had at Tufts Takes the material and explains it really clearly His grading is extremely fair and you can tell he has a ton of hands on and real life experience with the subject It was only his first year and he was my favorite Fall semester lecturer 
This class was poorly managed to say the lest The provides for lab were never working and the lectures were dry and hard to follow He is hard to understand if you are a novice corder so if you have him for  I would suggest watching lectures on the topic he is covering online because they will  more clear and actually worth your time 
Excellent lecturer Comp  is a difficult class He did a great job explaining hard concepts 
Does an awesome job with a difficult class His lectures can be a little bit confusing but hes always more than willing to clarify when you ask questions 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
Mark is a good human being but a terrible professor He constantly goes off tangents and forgets to explain the really difficult stuff in class I have never been able to talk to him during his office hours because he is always in a rush to go to MIT or some other place He has some funny jokes and a few interesting anecdotes

Really hard to stay awake in his classes His lectures have no organization whatsoever He will make even the easiest of things very hard to understand 
Great guy but can be difficult to understand He really loves the subject but can sometimes make it hard to understand Other times he throws out great analogues that make it easy to comprehend  HWs in total Each are hard minus  or  Feedback from HW is really miniscule and your grade will be unknown to you until its on your transcript

Sheldon can either be really entertaining in lecture or it can painfully difficult to stay awake Comp  is undoubtedly a hard course but the TAs in Halligan made it ten times easier  take advantage of them 
Not one of my favorite computer science professors His lectures seem disorganized and occasionally he will spend the majority of the time on a tangent He also uses vague and random analogies that make the material even more confusing Furthermore most of the time if you ask him a question he will tell you to look it up yourself 
Although Mark clearly knows what hes doing he was a horrible professor I had him for comp  and the course was extremely disorganized He is often rude and petty Homework instructions were often uncleardisorganized Lectures were boring and hard to follow Take comp  its really interesting material but not with Sheldon

Mark Sheldon is one of the smartest people I know However it seems as though his teaching and lecturing skills are below is intellectual level His delivery is scattered and often broken by nonsensical random tangents and when he does lecture about relevant information he lacks proper explanation lectures as if people know what he already does 
Sheldon is really passionate and knowledgeable about what hes teaching However he goes off on tangents a lot and doesnt actually teach much of the content we need to know during lecture so its kind of difficult to actually learn from him A lot of the teaching work falls on the TAs during lab and office hours instead 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK

TEST HEAVY 
Sheldon was unfriendly in office hours went on ridiculous tangents in lectures and let the burden of actually teaching the class fall completely onto the TAs Im a hard working student and put tons of time in but I had to drop halfway through the semester bc the course was poorly organized and highly stressful Try CS but not with him 
Does not actually teach in lectures He wastes far too much time on irrelevant topics and you will find yourself learning the concepts on your own Tests are also extremely hard 
Sheldons a good guy  but hes a mediocre administrator and a terrible lecturer Lectures had often spent most of their time on simply easy topics and breeze over difficult topics Provides for lab never worked and we were often given homework and not told what the expected output was Hes very helpful in office hours and homework was good 
Look Telling students very rudely in tangentfilled multipaged public responses to find answers themselves is not a good method of teaching an INTRO class It also doesnt really make timid students want to ask questions at all It just makes the jobs of TAs to also teach the material rather than just help Dont take this class with Mark

wandering lectures vague feedback and deliberately unclear grading at least in  so you wont know how you did until its set in stone exams are really difficult one really helpful resource is the set of slides made amusingly by the other  prof general expectation is that youll spend your entire semester on one class use the TAs 
Sheldon is a great CompSci professor and an asset to the department He is very good at explaining things to beginners 
Computer science is not exactly the best subject to learn by listening to a lecture so Im not sure if it was his fault that I didnt really like lecture Its better to learn comp by just doing the projects Mark is still a great guy though Hes very helpful and in the end I learned a lot in this class

I think people get frustrated with the class and Mark because they simply dont start the projects on time He is pretty generous with his grades and you get a note sheet for exams so you have the ability to write down pretty much everything youve learned

Professor Hasselmann is a very intelligent enthusiastic and helpful professor He is always willing to help outside of class Very open to all opinions and very fair with grading Workload About  pages of reading per class with a midterm and fi 
He is a very nice lecturer Knows his stuff very well and very accommodative of dissenting views 
James is a pretty cool guy he does his best to make calculus a normally boring subject into something somewhat fun He constantly tells horrible jokes during class that he and everyone knows are horrible which make them funny Attendance is only mantadory one day a week on quiz day Overall probably the best you can ask for out of calc  prof

Dr Adler was my best teacher here He is super approachable nice and hot You have to study alot and really know the concepts inside and out to do well but Dr Adler is willing to help you achieve His office hours were awesome and he is a really awesome teacher 
Really loved Adler He was new to the school this year but not to teaching or the subject matter He knew what he was talking about explained it clearly made it interesting and made it fun His background is in physics and applied math so he shared some insights into the applications of what we were learning too Id love to have him again 
Great teacher He is not a hard professor but the material is really tough He is extremely helpful during class and office hours Textbook is needed for hws Tries to make it fun with terrible jokes and he really wants all to do well Calculus  is just a hard class in general but he is the teacher you want to have if you have to take it

James Adler is the best Hes funny an excellent teacher and really entertaining He told us math jokes every day at the end of class hes awesome Forgot to mention hes hot as hell Id come to his office hours any day 
This class as all other Calc III classes here was fairly difficult That being said Adler does a great job of teaching Hes a genuinely kind and relatable person who is always there if you need help His corny sense of humor just adds to the enjoyment too If I had to pick a Calc III professor itd be him 
Very good professor if you can take him 
Great Teachers Hard class due to department standards across all calc classes

Great teacher really wants students to succeed Made A LOT of time for office hours and extra help showed applications of theories he was teaching and loved corny math jokes which is a plus Pretty rigorous course but thats across all Tufts Math  classes 
Best possible professor for math  Gives mostly odd homework problems quizzes are comparable to the easiest possible homework problems so theres a easy  pts for hw and quiz Clears all confusion to course material or hw problems during office hours Anyone taking Jamess class is very lucky 
Prof Hirsch is wonderful

Professor Hirsch is fantastic Super passionate about what he teaches which really shows If you like history lectures youll love the class Readings arent too bad and he goes over everything you need to know in class Exams arent too bad either if you show up for class everyday 
Great Guy Lectures are tedious but if you go to class he will help you get a good grade 
Greece Rome and China is an extremely difficult course Not to be taken lightly The lectures are tedious the readings are dense and the exams are difficult 
Great professor Extremely passionate Knows his stuff and is always willing to takeanswer questions 
Lectures are fairly parallel to the readings Three papers two tests are the only grades or assignments throughout the class If you go to class or do the reading youll do well A bit dull for nonhistory majors but not too hard Really nice prof 
History of Greece Lectures are usually boring but typical for a history class if you like that sort of thing Must do the reading should go to class Exams are graded somewhat strictly Hirsch is funny whenever possible He is extremely intelligent which is probably why the exams are so specific

Murphy makes accounting as interesting as it possibly could be with his good sense of humor and knowledge of the subject That said accounting is sort of hard and his tests can be nitpicky Get the book and read it Class lectures arent enough unless you have photographic memory  tests make the grade 
A great professor really works hard to make a dry subject fun and interesting 
Best econ teacher Makes accounting fun  tests each worth  of grade and thats it Straight from the book no tricks Even easier if you get old tests because he barely changes them 
Professor Murphy makes very dry accounting interesting He explains things very well and relates the material to our everyday lives frequently A fun class that isnt terribly difficult Murphy definitely made the class worth the effort and time Hes willing to help his students whether they need to reschedule and exam or have a question 
Great teacher He knows the material cold and really wants us to learn it The accounting material is very dry but the background financial information is really interesting 
Is very clear and writes all the notes out on the chalkboard so he is really easy to follow Still interesting 
Jack Ridge is the manhe really wants to help all his students and went around to memorize all our names on the first day of lab The tests are harder than I thought they would be but definitely accomplishable and his lectures are super clear and descriptive Clearly he loves geology and sharing his passion 
Jack Ridge is the best Material can be dry and boring at time but course is generally interesting and Ridge is the most knowledgeable professor in his field I have had Plus he used to dig holes for a living out west and wear cowboy hats 
Jack Ridge has a pretty boring lecturing voice that lulls you to sleep but if you drink lots of coffee before class or continuously pinch yourself to wake up at  in the morning the material is interesting and he is clearly passionate about what he does Makes me want to be a geologist 
hot 
Knows his stuff He writes everything on the board but sometimes a little hard to organize in your head Theres a lot of material to know for the exams The tests are a little hard but there are a lot of questions so if you dont know one there are plenty of others The labs are a joke No lab reports or real grade All you need to do is show up

Makes a boring sibject worth staying awake for but the tests are no walk in the park and the labs are pointless because they arent handed in or graded 
Jack Ridge is the quintessential geology professor right down to the gravelly voice and lame rock puns While his voice may be a bit soporific at  in the morning he is consistently clear and thorough in his lectures and always ready to answer a question The tests are pretty difficult its no easy science credit but the info interesting

my favorite professor 
Class was a great intro to public policy Good connections between environmental and social policy issues Lots of good debate and discussion moderated and supported by Agyeman Oh yeah and he is pretty gorgeous 
Wellliked teacher and is caring However standards are low and he is extremely ideological Not open to alternative views Grades are based on whether you agree with his agenda 
i cant believe were all talking about the same prof this guy is an expert he has a position which he makes clear at the outset he invites criticism and he really challenged my assumptions and biases hes what grad school is about 
Julian is one of the best professors I have had the pleasure of learning from His enthusiasm and energy inspire And despite his wealth of acumen he never talks down to students It is an amazing gift for a professor to have to be able to make his students feel as if their comments are just as valuable as his And oh yeah he is super hot too 
Julian is a blow hard Super nice guy a little arrogant but very friendly Class is next to worthless even though he has his students in the palm of his hand were all in that class because we believe in sustainability and doing something about it Unfortunately it teaches you almost nothing 
Class was useless but Agyeman was good 
Tricky if you are not into his thing Challenges you if you hold different beliefs 
good class discussions challenging teacher somewhat idealistic and could be more practical

Hard to ask questions of sometimes goes off on tangents but otherwise a decent and very understanding guy who I believe is a fair tester and grader 
he is extremely boring and the lectures have very little to do with the reading

LECTURE HEAVY 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
Tests make up most of your final grade and anything from his lectures as well as in the textbook are fair game He doesnt try to bridge the gap between the two making the content for studying large in volume and extremely disorganized Hes nice and wellintentioned but should not be in the classroom especially not for an introductory course 
He loves Bayesians He goes too fast sometimes and writes something different from what he says on the board but overall  not bad If you pay attn in class and take notes on EVERYTHING he says then you should be fine for hw and quizzes which you can use your notes on The final seems is intimidating but I heard he scales a lot 
He is disorganized and almost none of the things he references in class are even online Im a good student my GPA is a Im not someone lazy complaining because they didnt do the work I promise he sucks Dont do it 
Longwinded and rambling and very full of himself overemphasizing his own importance in the field Lectures dont match the book and the tests are very hard and graded even harder Oftentimes he tells you things that are actually the opposite of what he means  names and dates ARE extremely important on tests regardless of what he says 
I dropped this class after a few weeks even though I love the topic Hes a very dull lecturer and even if you can pay attention he never seems to say much Also makes an awkward amount of eye contact 
Extremely wellorganized and knowledgeable Occasionally has difficulty explaining concepts at a lower nonexpert level but his desire for students to learn  understand never fails 
Great professor but hard to get a word in edgewise 
Professor Chechile is extremely bad at explaining concepts and manages to make even the most basic topics confusing He is also selfimportant and much of the lectures are based on his own research from  plus years ago I honestly would not take a class from him Though I love psychology this was a deeply unpleasant experience 
His tests are hard because his teaching style belies his testing style his seminar is very conversational and he does occasionally mumble important points but if you take good notes you will do well Big grading curve He is also reasonable if you have questions about your test if you have a good argument he may give you back a point or two 
I found this class to be interesting probably because I was interested in the material He is a bit dry but I still enjoyed the class and learned a lot His tests are pretty hard but he grades with a huge curve You have to take excellent notes and study hard to do well 
Omg sooo boring I could hardly stand to go to the lectures Luckily the Daily crossword kept me awake  
Prof Harder is soo boring He obviously knows a lot about psych though which I respect I didnt put enough effort into this class but if I had I would have enjoyed it a lot more Definitely bring caffeine to class 
Boring lectures clings to stale ideas long tests 
goes off on tangents hard tests 
snore 
Awesome overall and good looking in an unconventional way 
sounded like such an interesting class but he bored me to death unless he went on a tangent and in that case wasnt very much help for exams and his exams were multiple choice and quite vague especially since lecture did not clear this up 
So incredibly boring it is frightening Studying abnormal psych under his guise made me wish for narcolepsy as the only way to bear his class is to sleep through it Terrible knowledge of the material too Still he seems like a nice chap Shame really 
I was so excited to take this class but he is a terrible professor He lectures over material that is often not related to the readings His tests are extremely difficult but he does grade on a curve He knows a lot about the topic but his lecture nearly put me to sleep every day Avoid him if you can 
This was a really difficult class but I learned a LOT and really enjoyed it I highly recommend going to the graduate meetings as well as regular class because it will give you more background

Tests were extremely hard and your whole grade is based on the midterm final and optional  page extra credit paper You need to pay attention in class to do well There is a crazy amount of reading about  pages per week but youll come out at the end of it with a deep knowledge of psychotherapy A challenge but Im glad I made it 
Harders voice is monotone and he doesnt make an effort to bring the class in or motivate interest I like him because he does a great job of answering questions but I am facinated by psych so it is not hard for me to pay attention If you are not interested in psych dont take this class 
INCREDIBLY boring and monotone Goes on tangents and contradicts himself The material is incredibly interesting yet miraculously he manages to make it incredibly dull and basically takes all the life of the subject Avoid if at all possible

Prof Muentener isnt the worst lecturer but you also wont wake up every morning excited to take his class He does a pretty decent job of covering the subject but could delve more into details with the experiments that he ALWAYS includes on the exams Also I went to his office hours many times and he really wasnt accommodating so that sux

I initially felt discouraged about taking Game Design with Wiser because of the bad ratings here but took the risk and went with it anyways and loved it Hes incredibly nice very thoughtful and has years of experience in the industry One of the most eyeopening classes Ive taken at Tufts  going into the psychology of games is so interesting 
good teacher straight to the point very understanding 
By far the worst professor Ive had at Tufts His lack of effort in presenting material and creating exams is evident his midterms are two randomly selected books problems avg of st midterm was  and lectures him reading off premade notes from the projector He does not give partial credit either 
Prof Kachanov does not teach the material well He knows what he is talking about and wants to see students succeed but he has no idea how to break down the material into simpler concepts I also sought him out multiple times and he was either unavailable stood me up or completely unhelpful DO NOT waste your time in his class 
At first very intimidating but really cares about his students and their understanding of the material Responds well to feedback 
Prof Kachanov is a nasty guy He is not nice and is bitter mean and illspirited He hates America Americans and students who dont understand instantly Steer clear 
He can be confusing and vague and the class is really boring but he is helpful if you just ask and he does care about how well you understand the material 
A horrible teacher 
He digresses a lot and cant explain things in a concise matter The subject matter isnt that difficult but his lectures make it confusing He is very nice and easy to talk to though 
He rambles a lot and can be boring Hes a little wacky but definitely loves the subject The class he teaches is more about a conceptual understanding than a mathematical one He grades pretty easy labs and homework are basically a given  Tests not so much but he lets you have a cheat sheet for every one 
RUN dont walk away from this mans courses He never teaches the material is dreadfully boring and is a hard marker in the end He should not be teaching anymore 
Worst teacher ever He shows up about  minutes late everyday not that it matters because the time that he is there is spent writing illegible nonsense on the board often unproved equations then playing with them and arriving at a new equation which isnt the right answer cuz there is no answer he was just playing with it for no reason 
One of my favorite classesWe did the math  discussed the philosophyHe brings his excitement to the materialsometimes that takes him on a tangentVery nice guyshows concern for students His lectures arent as structured as somethey are more like discussionsbut some learn better that way 
Not good Doesnt talk about the material in a meaningful way and doesnt explain anything or talk about how to do problems He just blabs about nothing And he assigned a textbook that isnt published yet so its in a binder but his friend wrote it so were basically proofing it which is a waste of time since its not a good book 
I hate physics but during recitation sections he makes Physics bearable due to the unbelievable love he shows for the subject

Fall  Extremely nice and friendly professor Spends a lot of time in discussion with the class Which is an admirable trait but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing Class would be far better if he spent more time on example problems etc I suspect that his teaching style is highly effective when the class size is small

Gallagher is clearly caring about his students He is always willing to discuss grades and give you motivation to keep going 
The material was interesting but the tests asked about obscure details and examples not relevant to understanding the material Memorizing all the random examples is more efficient than reading the textbook Diagrams confusing  AM is too early 
animal behavior was absolutly amazing very organized great lecturer interesting cared about students alot 
The class was fascinating and his teaching was captivating I was never bored and challenged in a way that was fair 
Professor Starks is a wonderful professor who makes the lectures fun The tests are difficult but fair Regrades are allowed and the material is fascinating 
His class wasnt that great and I didnt like his lecture style because it was too unstructured to take good notes for the tests which are really hard btw 
He is a great lecturer and cares alot about what he teaches The only problem is that his tests are ridiculous Even if you know the material insideout they are impossible and ask the smallest most insignificant details

Amazing class and hilarious professor It can be frustrating to try to memorize all of the examples covered in class but it is worth it because it makes the tests a breeze He curves the class too Give yourself plenty of times to study for exams He makes lots of jokes and tells lots of stories in class Very personable 
The lectures were great and interesting at  in the morning on FRIDAY but the testsd screwed you over asking unreasonable details that dont convey your understanding of the concepts His diagrams were also hard to understand but the movies were good 
Professor Starks is the man 
He is very clear very helpful Diff EQ is the hardest class at Tufts Take it with a friend more than one in case they drop and do every homework 
Hoft is great His notes are very clear and organized as is his writing Goes over homework at the beginning of class and more during office hours if needed I defintely recommend taking advantage of his office hours Hes excellent with explaining and finding your mistakes if you cant find them on your own 
hes great 
A phenominal professor I would definitely recommend the course even though it is rigorous he really does a great job of making you enjoy the material 
I had Peter first as a teacher and then as a boss for the course of a summer He is one of the most caring smart generous professors out there 
Simply the best prof i have ever had If you are fortunate enough to have him in your college i advise you to TAKE HIS CLASSits hard but its very much worth iteven if you are not interested in the subject after his class you will be 
This class was extremely interesting He is very knowledgeable on Egypt and its wonderful to be in a class where the professor LOVES the topic Fair tests Go to class it helps a lot 
Prof Der Manuelian is by far the best professor i have had at Tufts so far He is really caring and wants his student to do well And this class Egyptian Hieroglyphs I is really really interesting I recommend it to anybody with even a slight interest 
I would give him  chili peppers if I could 
Peters classes can be a bit slow paced but he is the most friendly guy ever If youre stuck on a project he helps you get going The only bad thing is that he is TOO knowledgeable on Egypt so you have to really know your stuff for presentationspapers 
Hes AWESOME Take his classes All of them I would if I could I took Egyptian Literature in Translation and it was AMAZING Heavy focus on class discussion classes are kind of unstructured but that leaves A LOT of room for expressing your opinion Oh and also he gives you free stuff Gummy crocodiles And posters from the MFA  
His classes are wonderful they are always illustrated with slides and with his personal experience in archaeology Hes kind and caring and wants you to do well in his class Try Egyptian Hieroglyphs if you get the chance 
Class was pretty boring  his PowerPoints are pretty to look at but his lectures can get tiring quickly But it IS ancient Egypt so the class naturally is interesting Midterm was fair but the final was far too hard for its own good If youre looking for a relatively easy art class with  field trips this is a good one to take 
Peter is kindest teacher in the classics department and actually cares about the undergrads 
I had Andy for two courses Spanish  and for his translation workshop I love this guy Hes the quirkiest guy Ive ever met and at first it seems as though he may even dislike you But really its his sense of humor and when you get to know him its fantastic His workshop was absolutely excellent  I learned a ton Take a class with him

He really tries to make sure the class understands the lectures with demonstrations and multiple ways of explaining a concept A really important part of his class is to ask questions If you dont understand something ask a question because chances are everyone else is confused and he doesnt know theyre confused 
Lectures are a bit hard to follow as he has written them out before hand to project onto screen though it is helpful because the same notes are online Ask him to go through the math if he skips steps Tests are typical for the chbe department You can get away with skipping a few lectures if you use the online notesbook 
This was the first class Professor Nair taught  and it was a hard one to teach He did a good job with really tough material In the middle of the semester he even asked for detailed feedback on his teaching and changed his teaching style accordingly This class was hard but he definitely did his best to teach it well 
Terrible Deaf to feedback An unreasonably harsh grading scheme and advice like Those of you in the bottom all brackets of the last exam do better and try harder should be expected  reliance on textbooks for lecturesHWexams Stickler on handing in HW on time WORST professor Ive ever had Hes new so maybe hell improve with time 
Certainly the worst professor Ive had at Tufts Exams were  questions that were unrepresentative of material taught The material is insanely hard with no help from the poorly given lectures We were given one book but the course was taught based on a different book Scaling scheme was unclear Put stuff on exams that wasnt covered Good luck 
Professor Nair was not given the credit that he deserved As a new teacher he initially struggled finding what was the best way to teach the class Throughout the semester he made many changes that helped the overall understanding of the material The content was hard but doable if the time and effort was put in to understanding what was given

BIO  was team taught by Professors Orians and Reed and Orians was by far the weaker of the two He seemed to get confused while presenting often probably because he just didnt know how to explain something which made him seem less knowledgeable Good thing the subject matter in BIO  was pretty selfexplanatory 
The lectures were all powerpoints that were based completely on the textbook which made it extremely boring The course was not tied together very well and no one was prepared for the midterm The final consisted of essay responses which averaged over ten pages The professors were nice though and were helpful in office hours 
Lectures are mostly series of examples not very well tied together into concepts even though exams are based on these concepts Lecture powerpoints posted on blackboard which eases notetaking Somewhat unfocused course that I hoped would be more interesting Tests are harder than expected but grading is not too tough

He was very boring and at times seemed as though he didnt know what he was doing I could barely stay awake during the class Its taught by two teachers and hes definitely the worst one I took this class just to fulfill the science requirement but I felt it required much more time out of class than I was willing to give it

OLeary is good guy but this class felt like a chore Attendance is mandatory but his lecture is impossible to follow and aside from Christianity he doesnt really know what hes talking about Take this course if you want an easy A but only if you dont care to learn much about religion and dont mind being extremely bored for  hours a week

I found his lectures to be very disorganized He often doesnt have answers for questions asked in class Office hours and review sessions were held offcampus where he works Its convenient for him but not the  students in the class Also the final exam had multiple  errors that he had to correct during the exam 
Theres lots of content and he moves quickly through lectures but if u go to office hours hes super helpful He uses piazza too so if u have questions outside of classoffice hours hes usually on top of that

One of my favorite professors at Tufts I always leave his class Intro to Japanese Culture with lots of thoughts and new ideas on my mind Forces you to think critically and challenges students He is thought provoking a deep thinker and eccentric 
His lectures were completely nonsensical More importantly he had an inability to seperate his personal beliefs on love and religion from class which meant you had to agree with him to do well

My favorite class at Tufts so far and its not even in my major Charles is a provocative poignant lecturer who has a genuine interest in sharing a balanced and thoughtful perspective of Japanese culture The weekly exercises are a nice break from my more intense coursework and the readings are all interesting If hes teaching a class take it 
His psets are near impossible to do unless you go to office hours where he ends up having to give you the answers because its so difficult everyone else in the class is in the same boat so OH ends up being extended class time His tests are somewhat easier compared to the psets but are by no means easy Def a hard class but youll learn a lot 
had him for the spring quite a new professor but overall good goes a little fast 
Overall a really friendly guy Goes through the lecture pretty fast and the material is somewhat difficult You can tell he has a big math background because he gets lost in explaining mathematical concepts I feel like many of us dont understand However overall a solid teacher 
Incredibly engaging and helpful Not every econ prof actually gets the class engaged in a conversation Macro with Prof Chiang was one of the best courses I took as an undergrad He definitely boosted my interest in economics And to boot he wasnt a stickler about due dates

E is one of those professors who may be disorganized but has such a knowledge and true love of what he is teaching that it is infectious The man is incredibly approachable unlike several Tufts history profs I learned very much from him and while he may not be the teacher for everyone he really resonated with me Great class too 
I definitely have to second what the commenter above me saidEulogio is VERY knowledgeable but he is just too disorganized to be an effective teacher Readings were sometimes emailed to us the night before class And the content of the course was fascinating but very unfocused 
Eulogio is passionate about what he teaches but he is disorganized readings were given as copies after he promised us a reader Hes unclear about what he wants in presentations and grades are based on favoritism I passed everything in on time and got a B while others passed things in late and got an A Wouldnt take another class from him

Perlman is very arrogant Hell brag about how he can finish his own exam in  minutes He also makes obscure references to TV shows and sayings from the early s that no one gets then implies that were uneducated if we dont understand Asks for questions on the homework but wont give you a clear answer Listen for youre not smiling 
Always makes sure the class understands the material and the homework Very approachable Great Professor 
Boring as hell and his projects all sucked I wont ever take another with him 
Not clear at all Homework and tests did not relate to material taught in class or book at all 
He was alright Did not appear to be that interested in part time professionals 
Be prepared to teach yourself His homework assignments and tests which comprise your grade have nothing to do with what is taught 
This man will school you but in nothing that relates to engineering His exams do not relate to the material taught in class Dont take it for the material take it for his crazy advice and accent 
sucks 
says basically a lot 
Prof Saigal is a brilliant man who is too aloof to be a good professor Though his comments are often humorous he teaches the class as though no one is in the room He makes no effort to even learn his students names The class can be very confusing at times Homework is often disconnected from what is asked on exams 
I took two classes w Prof Saigal Computer integrated engineering quality control Saigal was a better professor at computer applications 
The class is very difficult and a lot of work but he is such a nice guy and really goes out of his way to help his students 
previous comments have nailed it you literally could not find a more helpful prof personally helped me get caught up when I joined the class late and always checked in with me throughout the semester if youre struggling in the class hell sit with you and help you till you get it

Makes himself extremely available and works crazy hours in Halligan helping students whenever possible Extremely grumpy and quick tempered at times dont test him 
Pretty funny guy but lectures are pretty pointless as most of the time is spent deriving equations and he does not do practice problemsTests wouldnt have been as hard if we were better prepared from lecture I worked very hard for this class and didnt feel like it paid off From what I could tell Jose didnt care much about the course 
There are few people Ive met who are genuinely brilliant but Professor Rastegar is one of them This was a truly fascinating course and I recommend anyone whos remotely interested in postcolonial theory social justice or activist film take Fairly easy to do well if you put in the effort Rastegar makes the class and he is patient and intuitive 
Class can be a bit awkward and boring at times and the readings somewhat long and fairly dense That said Rastegar is incredibly knowledgeable on what seems to be everything When a good discussion gets going it really gets going Bottom line worth taking if interested in postcolonial theory andor film

I loved seeing the way that statistics is relevant to our everyday lives and can provide concrete quantitative answers to questions that can otherwise be seen as subjective It made me see that on some level we can quantify things like inequity and injustice and I found that very powerful This class also made me feel confident applying statistic 
Awesome prof I learned a lot and he is very encouraging

For physics  you cant do better than Professor Tobin His method of teaching made me learn real physics rather than simply the regurgitation of formulas that people often associate with the subject Although I am not the biggest fan of physics I really appreciated this class and his enthusiasm for the subject 
He really cared a lot about the subject even though it was a low level course He was my best teacher this year Fantastic class

Guy is a dork but knows that he is and that makes him awesome He knows his stuff and like he has said could explain most things to a three year old

Tobin is clear in his lectures and provides a lot of support to help you learn the material He gives lots of homework problems and and online checkins His tests are pretty difficult and the labs absolutely suck 
tobin is a smart guy but doesnt have control over large lectures he wastes a lot of time with class polls and can get carried away answering a question that is not related to what is being taught overall though if the class is not crazy tobin is a great teacher

Likes to tell bad jokes but its funny Pretty Good Professor 
Extremely hard class but he did a good job with it 
I very much enjoyed this class It was certainly difficult and time consuming but I thought he did a good job presenting the material and explaining the difficult parts Although expectations were set quite high they were fair 
One of the best professors Ive had His humorous puns keep the relatively tedious material a little more bearable EXTREMELY organized lectures with clear logic and clear progression throughout the course Teaches in a way that students can understand well Incredibly knowledgeable and can answer every question you throw at him 
Hasselblatt was a very nice prof he was relatively clear in lecture and was not at all intimidating at office hours The tests were tough but if you really studied hard you could do well Calc is not an easy subject but Hasselblatt makes it manageable which is more than the other profs can say from what Ive heard Hes good but not amazing

I took poetry with him and he was great Hes funny and makes the  hour block go by pretty fast A lot of the girls in my class did not like him and Im not sure why He might have an arrogant undertone but hes super nice to everyone The class is easy and you just have to write poems weekly There are sometimes short papers He grades easy 
Hes a nice funny guy I enjoyed the class even though  hours of poetry any class really can be rough Class is mostly workshop Mark doesnt expect much from your work so feel free to be as creative as you would like and try new things Some thought he was stuck up but I did not get that feel from him 
Took adv principles of exercise with him The class is mostly athletes so its pretty lax The quizzes are informative but dont count towards the final grade as far as I could tell He grades based on your enthusiasm for your project and the subject matter and the effort that you put into the final program Overall awesome class easy A great guy 
Mufti doesnt put relevant information in his lectures nor does he assign particularly relevant readings He has no structure to his lectures and I often find myself unable to take accurate notes because he skips around doesnt complete thoughts He isnt very accessible nor is he helpful when you do

Professor Mufti is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT I came out of almost every single one of his lectures feeling inspired If IR is your thing then you HAVE to take the intro class with him As for grades most people land in the B range very few Cs and if you work hard its not at all impossible to get an A

The first half of the semester is deep in theory Mufti does a good job of pulling from the readings and clearing things up Later in the semester the readings and the lectures became totally unrelated Studying for the final was scary as we had to know readings never talked about in class Unclear a bit condescending but smart guy

Incredibly jolly likeable guy lectures often very entertaining Much more hardnosed and ruthless approach to IR lots of emphasis on war strategy etc than the more idealistic academic framings frequently used Loves Thucydides so be prepared for surprises regarding that on exams Its a big class but you have to try to participate 
Mufti loves theory and its amazing how much integrates theory into the course His anecdotes are truly amazing and appropriate and he clearly relates them to course material  when time comes for the test you will recall those anecdotes 
Very interesting teacher if you are interested in the Middle East he is the number one Because he specifically lived throughout the region Jordan Turkey Lebanon etc He is a harsh grader and the tests are very hard Class is very interesting but sometimes he moves on very quickly He expects people to know the material before coming to class 
Mufti is clearly a brilliant man and his lectures are very interesting He tries to have class participation even in such a huge lecture but he tends to ignore a lot of what is said Id recommend him but he is quite intimidating and a hard grader He told our TA that he refuses to give out As 
His lectures are terrible He adds a lot of unimportant information and doesnt help in understanding the material and readings Half of our readings consisted of learning about WWI and WWII The exams consist of  IDs and  essays that counts for  of your grade

Interesting lectures but completely arbitrary grading Tests consist of  IDs which means that students that dont do readings but can memorize  blurbs on a sheet do ok Bs and those that attempt to do all the readings and inevitably run out of time will not Unnecessarily difficult course for material that is interestingsimple on its own 
Hardly any homework or weektoweek work weird and hardtopredict exams Lectures are just long derivations of known formulas Nice guy but the class is badly organized and taught 
IF YOU CAN AVOID TAKING PHYSICS  WITH HIM  DO IT One of the worst professors Ive ever encountered at Tufts His homeworks are too easy just plugging in numbers into equations his exams have no connection to what you do on the homework All he does is just derive equations on the board and he doesnt explain the concepts at all Horrible 
TOUGH GRADER 
He is literally the worst professor in the department His homework are incredibly easy you can look them all up but his exams have nothing to do with the coursework at all If you can avoid taking a class with him I would HIGHLY recommend anyone else 
This is a worthless class The information is so basic and he gets it all directly from the book so why anyone would attend this awful class is strange to meunless of course you LIKE hearing the teacher talk about himself and ask superficially philosophical questions only to negate them by saying Well get into that later 
Unprofessional and unqualified In Intro to Peace and Justice studies we spent  of the time brainstorming what was meant by peace war and justice It felt more like he was surveying us than teaching us anything Coupled with three  page papers which he very harshly graded this was a waste of my time and a GPA killer 
A great class and a great teacher Very interesting a dynamic lecturer Reasonable with his grades good grades definitely attainable if you work and put in the time 
Very intelligibleinteresting But he is very unorganized He is in a learning stage He will improve with honest feedback and not people saying they cant stand him He tries I have had two classes with him He is very liberal and concerned about all 
not as liberal as he pretends to be extremely arrogant tries too hard to be your friend 
I really enjoyed Matts class and his assignments were interesting but its true that hes a little arrogant If you actually devote time to thinking about the material on your own it can be really fulfilling If you only go to class you wont get as much out of it as you could You basically make it what you want Overall Id recommend it 
sooo damn cocky always talks about himself and his stupid motorcycle cant stand him 
Hes a great guy and really wants to help you think about soc within the context of your life Some really neat projectsfood for thought for objetcive knowledge hes not so good like we didnt learn the book exam is hard specific and not relevant 
Class is pretty simple lots of readings but none are required Only work is a midterm and essay Matt is engaging and cares what his students think Very liberal and a self proclaimed Marxist A little selfserving 
Great professor his lectures are always engaging and interesting The projects are easy but thought provoking and the reading selections are good 
Class is intersting Lots of discussion lots of reading but you dont have to do it all kind of disorganized also very liberal 
This class was a waste of my time Matt is arrogant selfobsessed and unable to see alternative viewpoints Class time was spent with a different brainstorm topic every class and he often shot discussion participants down instantly discouraging others to join in While Matt is passionate he does not create a productive learning environment

Prof Gregory is the WORST professor Ive ever had He made a mistake on my grade and after contacting him  times emailing him wo getting responses and finally getting in touch with him he admitted to his mistake I had to go to the Chair of the dept  she had to override the grade HERSELF

Matt is definitely a very engaging teacher who makes class all about discussions As for the material it is hard to follow the focus of the class and where he is going in lectures Overall great guy to talk to outside of class 
Pretty easy class Good readings recommended but not mandatory Id recommend it 
He makes class interesting 
He spends way too much time talking about himself and the class is too unstructured for an intro to the subject 
Very unorganized has trouble getting back to you when you try to contact him Was a very good lecturer but didnt spend as much time and effort in grading projects 
He is unclear in instructions and wording on tests and homework unhelpful when approached and unrepentant and unforgiving even when he does admit that you were punished for his lack of clarity in wording He is the worst at answering questions of any sort that I have come across 
If you went to class or even just read the powerpoints it was very easy to do well Kimballs organization of the course was very clear and material was presented so that even mathematically challenged people can do fine

hes so funny hes amazing 
hilarious very knowledgeable about the language gives you the grammar rules and the realities of how things are used his class is a great time but i also learned a ton 
Hes awesome and super funny Hes an easy grader and one of the most flexible and understanding professors Ive ever had I know some people had trouble with his fast speaking and spanglish he flips between languages alot but it wasnt a problem for me 
Hes an amazing teacher Class was interesting every day and sometimes we never stopped laughing Despite the good times you still actually learn something This has been my favorite class so far and I strongly recommend taking any of his classes 
He knows his stuff but poorly articulates it If you are able to listen to what he says and recognize when to apply it youll do fine Its just very boring and hard to maintain interest The textbook helps a lot which solidifying what Blumer talks about Classes arent too helpful neither are sections Not my favorite CS class 
He was filling in for Couch when I took him but I feel like I missed out on a lot in that class 
He is not good at answering questions because he cant seem to see what the students dont understand 
TOUGH GRADER 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Blumer knows his stuff hes just bad at articulating it to his students Read the textbook chapters before you head to class and things will make a lot more sense He grades pretty hard and his homeworks are tough and can take a long time Algorithms is a good thing to learn for CS so definitely try to make the most of it 
smart perhaps to a fault bc at times doesnt understand whenwhy students have a problem following clear and concise explanations but can get carried away with boardwork strict and uncompromising surprisingly subtle and dry sense of humor 
He is very fair in grading though his tests are difficult He is very helpful when approached with questions and seems concerned for the wellfare of students Occasionally his lectures are a little difficult to follow 
His classes were essentially useless I would avoid him unless you plan on teaching yourself the material 
Douglas Preis is a terrible sneaky professor who knows he does a bad job but doesnt care because tufts doesnt have the courage to fire him 
Worst professor Ive had in college EE or not 
All I can really say is that he is Bojangles His beard is long and i want to tug it His horrible style of teaching is more than made up for by the show he puts on I love that bojangly  
He isnt the best teacher and no electronics in class but if you pay attention youll do fine 
One of the best teachers Ive had He makes the material so easy to understand Almost everyone in my class got As while kids in other classes with different profs who took the same exams struggled to get Bs He is one of the few proffesors who actually gave a damn who I was 
Class is structured horribly independent of professor For Preis hes friendly approachable and knowledgeable However he is rather boring and very laid back which actually does more harm than good Class isnt especially difficult but be prepared to teach yourself the material before each quiz and exam Not the worst ES  prof though 
Explains concepts very well He really cares about his class 
His lectures were very repetitive Try to find a different section if you can didnt learn a whole lot from him as a teacher 
He is the worst professor at tufts I didnt learn anything in his class He makes the class so boaring and not interesting but in reality its a very interesting topic to learn He is a waiste of time and moneyskip him if you can 
Preis is adorable I love love LOVE him But I cant understand what the hell he talks about in class The class has no structure and his lectures have no apparent point But like I said I still cant help but love him 
never available when needed office hours NOT had to seek out prof Vo to get help 
Stay clear of Douglas Preis He is a terrible teacher 
Finest professor in town 
Kind of boring but the tests were easy and the course wasnt bad 
He has no idea what is going on You will learn nothing but still be the best student he has ever seen The constant jerking back and forth of his long thick beard will keep you mesmerized for hours 
Expects us to understand his ramblings and chicken scratch Assigns extra work AFTER the class is over a weekend before the final because he didnt plan well enough 
Sliwa is a very enthusiastic teacher sometimes a little too enthusiastic He writes all over the board talks fast and speeds through the material but if you need help he will do all that he can to help you He even tutored me through Phy  He knows his stuff and he is very passionate about Physics 
I liked him a lot he knows his stuff 
I didnt like Sliwa at first but now that I have him as a recitiation teacher I realize hes really quite good he REALLY knows his stuff which counts for a lot hes really nice and willing to help not his fault that phys  is a crap course 
Professor Sliwa is clearly a very nice man and probably very good at the research he does However he does not know how to teach He is unclear in class and the homework and lectures have nothing to do with the actual tests If you can avoid taking his class do so because if you have any hope of doing well you will need to teach yourself 
nice funny guy not a bad professor 
He is very willing to help students at office hours and he is seems genuinely concerned with students understanding of the material Excellent professor and it is nice to see someone that is so enthusiastic about his subject 
Love him Hes so passionate about physics that its contagious He gives makeup exams for the two during the semester He also gives demonstrations that he gets sooo excited about Hes such a sweetheart Ill miss him  
I liked him a lot he really knows his stuff 
Sliwa loves physics and tries to explain the course on a conceptual level However he fails to teach the material of the homework or tests Clarity is poor but he wants everyone to do well and is a nice guy 
Since I had prior experience in Physics Sliwas teaching style did not confuse me However for a newbie it might be difficult Sliwas answer keys for tests are absolutely atrocious hard to read and some mistakes Its likely that you dont have a choice but to take Phy with him so just suck it up 
cool 
Most underrated teacher probably the best one youll get for an introductory science classengineering requirement Sliwa has a sweet accent from what country I cannot fathom heavily curves final grades and has cool class demonstrations if you choose to attend class does unnecessary proofs 
He is a very fair professor for an introductory science class Tests are doable and he gives makeups Class can be boring but he is enthusiastic 
Easy class comes to conclusions in an odd way but explains it the next class Reviews everything from the class before for most of class then crams in everything new in ten minutes labs are easy 
Very difficult to understand Nice guy but best saved for upper level physics classes 
AMAZING LECTURES 
RESPECTED 
INSPIRATIONAL 
When you are in that lecture hall with him he takes you on a journey Although the journey can be bumpy at times he gets you where you need to go He adds bits and pieces of his extensive knowledge relevant or not into his lectures and that can be a good thing if you are a physicsjunkie like me or a bad thing if you just want to get it done 
Prof Sliwa is passionate about physics and loves to give demonstrations His exams are fair and he offers makeups which are a great option He is painfully boring but the text book is decent and he posts lots of material to enable you to teach yourself 
This is a hard class but I have never met a professor more willing to help students outside of class than Professor Sliwa He is so dedicated to helping students understand the material if you seek him out 
His accent melts girls like butter

I loved this class its worth waking up early for Because he is a wellversed writer and has a lot of experience has written a few books writes for Slate weve learned to read pieces with a more criticalappreciative perspective The class is pretty chill and he does a good job of giving great feedback 
Completly scattered and unoranized class is way too boring grading is arbitrary paper topics dull dreaded the class 
He is a great guy that really knows his stuff He grades fairly and is very helpful at office hours Definitely helped me become a better writer

I loved this class Swaffords a great guy who is really knowledgeable about film and writing he always has great feedback and ready to help Lectures are pretty laid back funny and exciting if you get into the topic Was a pleasure getting to know him As long as you show up to lectures and do the work the class is pretty straight forward 
Did not enjoy this class hes a very unorganized and boring professor Very knowledgeable about film however My advice make sure you are  interested in the subject before taking Disaster of a class if you dont like the material 
Hes unorganized and seems like there is no point to go to class bc we arent tested on lectures but hes very knowledgable with film The only work is papers and you chose your topic so it depends how interested you are in a paper that can make it fun He is a great guy to get to know and a very good writer If you like films I highly recommend 
A lot of the work feels like busy work and class at  in the morning is never awesome but he will help you pull straight through this class and hes always ready to help with getting you a good essay grade Really while I did not enjoy the class the class is a musttake since it walks you through college writing 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS

Hes pretty lenient about late assignments Most classes are discussionlecture occasional essay workshops very important to be there with a complete rough draft plus the film screenings He only comes to about half of those so you can get away with not going to them Be warned that writing for film is different than analyzing literature 
CARING 
Sweet guy a bit disorganized but he definitely cares a lot about the topic US  Latino relations and he really wants to get his students to engage with the subject matter If you participate in class hell love you 
He is disorganized wastes time on media gives no opportunity to write and bases your grade on two multiple choice  short answers exams The material is scattered and inconsistant Takes a long time to grade hard to get a hold of and very very unclear about expectations No clear lecture style I was truly disappointed in the course 
I took Professor Fernandezs anthropology class on the US Mexico Borderland culture at Tufts hes a visiting professor and loved it He is very approachable really passionate about the material and definitely knows his stuff He can sometimes be a little disorganised but he definitely cares about his students and is always willing to talk 
His powerpoints are useless they are literally unreadable since he has his name in huge font as a background watercolor Despite many many complaints from students about not being able to study let alone read his powerpoints he refuses to change Apparently he has them copyrighted is he scared someone is going to plagarize his work Huge eg 
Attendance is mandatory only because youre expected to participate the readings arent bad neither is the work load and he chooses good material to make the course really interesting Hes a good guy slightly nervous because hes new but definitely worth taking a class with him if youre interested in sociologyor not 
Prof Centner is a pretty good teacher His lectures are engaging and interesting They do get a little long 
Had zero interest in this class was only taking it as a major requirement but Centner really made it interesting Hes a great lecturer but it felt like he was a hardish grader Readings are manageable 
One of the best math teachers Ive ever had Very interested in his students success and genuinely happy when they succeed Always willing to help 
McGrath is an awesome professor He really knows his stuff and sends lots of helpful emails to his class that show his dedication to teaching Also he has a legendary voice 
Best professor Ive ever had I would strongly recommend him to anyone thinking of taking differential equations Never have I had the chance to learn from someone so genuinely interested in making sure that everyone understands the material I found the course itself was quite challenging but also hugely rewarding in the end 
Professor McGrath was good Hes pretty clear and definitely good to talk to during office hours Also pretty nice not the most engaging but not horribly boring either The only complaint I have is it sometimes seemed like he just skipped some things didnt have time or otherwise but nothing that couldnt be filled in by the book 
McGrath was a wonderful professor Sometimes you have to study on your own but hes extremely accessible and easy to talk to or email if you have any issues and he goes over questions in class He makes an effort to know everyones names 
Such an awesome guy What a boss Definitely one of my favorite math teachers so far Explained things extremely clearly and would answer any questions you had to the entire class He was a little robotic at times in his lectures but that really didnt take away from his teaching ability 
Great jokes personalized review sessions ACTIVELY involved in learningacademic well being of students

One of the most chill and accessible professors Ive had at Tufts The course had no pre reqs besides proof exposure but if you dont know any algebra or number theory youre gonna need to learn on the fly He knows that the background of the students varies a lot in this class and he will grade accordingly Unorganized but loves math and it shows 
Professor Cohen is the man He always made class interesting it was a  hour monday night block which sucked but he took a break in the middle had some snacks and watched a short video I learned more practical stuff in this class than in any other class I have taken and Prof Cohen is really good at relating what we do in class to real life 
I had Old English with Prof Fyler and I really loved having him He makes dry material interesting and hes always drawing rather odd but hilarious connections with random things Hes very lenient with due dates You dont need to read everything but he recaps the main parts during his lecture Im definitely taking Chaucer with him 
Awesome awesome prof Smart and makes even seemingly boring stuff interesting 
Articulate in presenting material wellchosen texts and good comments on semester papers He led a fine intense seminar I learned a lot 
Not the worst lecturer at Tufts but not a good one either If you take him be prepared for some redundancy You dont need to read all the books to do well Expect to listen to his complicated presentations on outside material Didnt learn much didnt particularly enjoy the class but it was good enough to fulfill the requirement He gets a C 
Prof Fyler does his best to make interesting material boring I think hes been teaching too long 
LECTURE HEAVY

Professor Fyler is very sweet caring and passionate but he assigns way to much reading Chaucer is already hard to understand but having to read thousands of lines per day with the addition of other texts is just too much And because no one did the reading Fyler dominated class discussion He does grade essays fairly easily though 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK 
Ive so far taken two classes and audited another with Professor Fyler He is an excellent teacher good at explaining texts providing context and promoting further thought He gives very good feedback and will provide commentary for essay drafts and outlines He also is fairly flexible with deadlines 
Very nice guy and a good teacher Enjoys literature for very intellectual reasons which can be a little hard to emphasize with but he always encourages class involvement and is incredibly respectful of his students and their opinions 
Hes not the best lecturer but hes still a very good professor Hes very understanding of what its like to be a college student he reminisces sometimes about his experiences in undergradgradschool I enjoy attending even though it doesnt seem required Lenient on due dates and is willing to help you understand material better Great guy 
Professor Fyler tries really hard to get us interested in the material even though the class doesnt talk much The class is more interesting than I thought it would be but Fyler requires a fair amount of tedious translating and kind of a lot of reading Hes a very nice guy and willing to help 
DO NOT TAKE HIM i swear he is the hardest professor ever if hist is your major than hes good but for a core do not take him 
I took his Rev America class and you had to show up to that He is a very strict grader and there is a lot of reading 
hes really helpful in office hours really approachable grades are fair you have to show up to class and do the reading its alot hard class but you get alot out of it 
I was really excited to take this class but it has been the worse class I have ever taken at Tufts The professor is unhelpful during office hours and doesnt seem too concerned about students understanding The papers are vague and leave you with no idea what he wants In addition he is a very strict grader I would NOT recommend this class 
I took Colonial North America with Professor Carp I definitely will not be taking another class with him again Hes a fair grader but his lectures were the most boring I have ever sat through at Tufts I hated going to class because it was impossible to pay attention and Im a pretty focused person He is not animated and is dry 
Carp obviously knows what hes teaching but he lectured CRAZY fast in class and refused to give us any kind of outline to help keep track of what he was talking about Very hard grader he has high expectations Thought he was a good enough teacher but probably wouldnt take a class with him again 
Afsar means well but hes hopeless as an introductory EE prof Very smart but cannot communicate basic concepts Hes horribly disorganized and outofstep and completely impossible to reach outside of class Also the overall setup of the course is careless and the textbook is extremely unclear unhelpful and overpriced 
Prof Afsar is sometimes difficult to understand but is always available for extra help His class usually does better in comparison to the others because the students are better prepared for the tests and know how to apply the material

He is a nice professor You wont learn a lot in his class related to the course but he will give you a good grade So down to earth and you will learn how to work in groups He considers the problems of students Highly recommendable 
Awful 
hes great in lower level classes however once concepts get more difficult its easy to get lost and you have to do alot of work on your own in order to do well on the exams 
The only class everyone showed up for after the firstso they could give him lousy recommendations He is a very nice well meaning guy But he was late alot and he was terrible at lecturing 
One of the best professors  Tufts Our class average was  on each exam the rest of the grade averaged in the s The guy is a savage 
At first you will have no idea what he is talking about But you will soon understand most of the concepts in the course and you will do really well on the tests 
Too nice 
Excellent professor Really nice guy Very helpful I cant say enough about Afsar Take him for ES  While you can expect to be completely lost for the first few weeks eventually itll all make sense And if it doesnt hell give you an A anyway A nice change to have a professor that really cares about his students understanding 
Most incomprehensible professor Ive ever encountered Lecture notes and homeworks were indecipherable handscrawled mess Lectures wandered and often wound up with offtopic discourses on completely random subjects like the merits of flying to DC via BWI or DCA If you just show up and do the work youll get an easy A but learn nothing 
Well meaning professor knows his field very well communication skills not up to par  only part of that is that his accent is difficult to understand Difficult not to do well in his class 
Very easy going great to talk to He does wing his lectures a lot and gives long evasive answers when not sure  typically drifts off topic yet there is typically a lesson there too his intro to uWave was good to learn youd need to study on your own At the same time hes an easy grader His style fosters teamwork in the classroom

Time I spent in EC lectures was a wasted opportunity cost this semester Enricos lectures were tangential nonlinear and generally unhelpful impossible to follow Our entire grade was based off of  tests  and problem sets which frequently covered material we never went near in class Everything I learned in this class came from the textbook 
He is really funny One can tell that he really enjoys what he is doing when he is teaching which is great He makes the topic interesting and is very clear during lecture If you go to office hours he is super helpful and also likes to chat about economics Definitely take a class with him

he is not open to any outside views which is unfortunate when you are teaching controversial opinions he always looks like hes about to fall asleep

Great guy extremely knowledgeable I found his lectures engaging and when I went in to his office to talk to him he definitely showed interest in me This was one of my favorite Tufts classes yet 
Brilliant no denying that but the most arrogant human being I have ever met The class is long dry and boring with more reading than is remotely reasonable but the use of films is interesting Not an easy A but you could get it if you were interested and cared a lot more than I did However he treated me like crp outside of class

Avoid this class at all costs But actually 
Took Americas with Winn last semester Gave me great feedback on assignments doesnt care so much about grades more about understanding the material Lectures can drift and the amt of weekly reading is near impossible but I did the chapters from his book and whatever else I could and got an A best prof to take a Latin America class with 
nice guy good teacher and his son class of  is quite beautiful 
Great Prof great guy great teacher You will learn a lot there is a lot of reading the workload is substantial but it is worth it He is one of the best teachers at Tufts Knows everything about Latin America and is very passionate encourages class involvement and is open to alternate ideasTake his classes 
Best class Ive taken This prof is so interesting and knowledgeable with so many amazing stories to share Class was sometimes long but worth it for sure Take plenty of notes and pick up on his catch phrases for your paper 
Avoid 
He is awesome knows everything possible about latin america enormous amounts of reading though make an excuse to go to his office its hilariously messy 
Winn is the most conceited professor Ive ever come across in four years of college and two years of graduate school He barely interacts with students sending them to TAs instead If you make an appt with him be prepared to have him stare blankly at you clearly thinking he is wasting his time He is arrogant and out of touch with realty

He explains things often in more detail than necessary While he could be more confident in lecture he spends too much time answering questions that could be easily found by a google search to Matlabs library His course is not hard if you take time to took up manual pages to functions in Matlab This is normal for engineers 
Means well but doesnt know how to convey or organize the material effectively and the class itself is not designed well for the type of material that needs to be learned There is very little connection between lecture homework and labs so it is incredibly hard to follow

Really bad at explaining the material and the lectures hardly cover what is in the homework I had to teach myself MATLAB or be taught by friends who had more experience coding Class is not accommodative to students who dont already know how to code Tests are hard and homework is ambiguous Need new professor for this class

GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
SO disappointed with this professor I was really excited to take this class but its been a complete disaster His inexperience with teaching is painfully obvious and most days in lecture its hard to watch More than half of the students who started this course have dropped and the remainder is praying for passing grades Take ML somewhere else 
Assignments were very poorly specified The most difficult and time consuming aspect of this class was just figuring out what was being asked of us and how we would be graded 
Not qualified for tenure Dont take a class with him 
TEST HEAVY 
TOUGH GRADER 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
This class is a total nightmare Its wildly disorganized its needlessly difficult and the prof clearly only wants a certain kind of student Hes borderline aggressive in emails if you can get him to respond Hes a disgrace to Tufts His weak grasp of English makes homework and projects nearly impossible to decipher The worst Ive ever taken 
Gonzalez loved it when people asked questions because he really wanted to help students understand A friendly guy and definitely available clear and direct I would recommend Math  if youre trying to get rid of your math requirement 
Not really understanding why everyone liked him so much 
It baffles me how he manages to lecture at a constant speed the entire  minutes and have everything so prepared and crystalclear The class was a little nonstop with a minute break halfway through but he made a fairly difficult subject extremely clear and enjoyable And his jokes though they are few are priceless Definitely recommended 
Fulton knows what hes doing Definitely the most efficient professor Ive had He flies through lectures but is very clear and organized so take lots of notes He really enjoys the material and his enthusiasm is contagious He even points out flaws in the textbook so go to class 
RESPECTED 
CARING 
Professor Gonzalez is a brilliant math professor who actually knows how to connect with his students He explains new material in a clear cut way and is very good at drawing D images He tells us it is his goal to make sure everybody gets an A but expects you to come with the same amount of effort Overall he is a talented funny and kind prof 
so helpful and nice always willing to meet w you outside of class 
Really clear in class and pretty understanding if you need to turn in a homework or two a little late Hes helpful in office hours and made a pretty boring class tolerable 
Cool dude Funny upbeat and knows his stuff thru and thru Will do problem sessions for psets where he basically gives you the answers Moves thru material quickly but effectively 
Professor Gonzalez is a wonderful professor He is clear thorough and enthusiastic He is one of the few professors that can do an entire lecture without glancing at his notes He knows the material well and likes it He clearly enjoys teaching and wants his students to learn a lot Take any class you can with him

Very smart and clear Homework assignments and tests were quite easy but sometimes it is hard to talk to him in private Overall enjoyed the course very much and would take any other math course with him for sure

Fulton is probably the best teacher I have ever had He is ridiculously good at drawing  dimensional surfaces which is essential in this course He has the funniest mannerisms and entertaining He is also a pro at understanding peoples questions Honestly if you are looking to take a math course at tufts take Calc  with Fulton 
nice guy teaches the material pretty clearly and consistently with the book so you can look to it if you are confused or missed lecture always happy to answer questions very approachable math  has a set syllabus so there was not much room for improvisation here but he did a good job with teaching us the material 
Fultons a genius and extremely good at explaining complex concepts The problem sets are challenging but fair The tests are all totally manageable and theres no tricky stuff you didnt learn in class Overall fantastic class and we got through a ton of material really clearly 
Fulton is really entertaining but Math  sucks Hes not that brilliant of a professor that you should take the class if youre not required too

Great Professor Made difficult linear algebra concepts simple to understand You actually learn a lot of stuff from him Problem sets get difficult towards the end of the semester but tests are easy

What a boring class I just cant sit through it anymore The guy doesnt know how to make the subject interesting at all 
Probably the best professor Ive had at Tufts An incredibly clear and captivating lecturer with a true talent for explaining complex concepts in ways students understand Always willing to put in extra time to help you succeed Obviously an incredibly smart guy Take a class with Brian Aull 
I never understood electricity until Prof Aulls class He really clarified a lot of the basic concepts from physics and then taught the harder material very well There were a couple topics that were a little fuzzy but overall he did a great job Not to mention that hes a super nice guy

Would strongly advise against any student taking a class with him The most boring professor I have had at Tufts Not receptive or engaging at all No one shows up to class because not only are his lectures boring but they also are not helpful I ended up teaching the material to myself Everything is straight out of the textbook

Lot of homework and boring lecture No review and explain for exam at all 
This course has a meticulously crafted curriculum led and created by an exceptional passionate and thought provoking professor Not an easy A be ready to read a lot apply the material and retain it you will need all of it at test time Plan on engaging in class and recitation Its a lot of work but such a good course 
Prof Art is a very solid professor He knows a bunch about what he teaches and he expresses general enthusiasm for the course material He is a pretty nice guy There are a lot of readings and most of it is essential to doing well in the course Lectures summarize the readings I didnt go to a single recitation and still did well 
One of the best PS professors at Tufts He is very enthusiastic engaging and accessible to students Incredibly interesting and really cares about students opinions He encourages student participation and tries to tailor the class to students interests 
Great teacher Very clear and explicit with what he wants Tests were straightforward and depended entirely on readings Grading was ok with class average usually a BB 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
RESPECTED 
this class was great mainly because it was so relevant as Brexit was changing day by day and David art was so enthusiastic about the events unfolding beginning of the course was very European history heavy with  fairly tough quizzes however grade could be redeemed with the  papers  was final that had a lot of freedom hes a character 
Great guy amazing credentials he knows what hes tlkaing about 
David Art is brilliant passionate and a nice guy His lectures can be discursive and with zero visual aid in his class it can be hard to stay on track for very visual learners The reading is doable but not easy and often pretty dry the TAs are incredibly helpful though  dont skip recitation unless you have to 
Art is such a bro The class has so much reading and lectures go fast but youll learn so much about politics He is an awesome guy who really cares about PS The exams are extremely fair The TAs are so helpful go to the nonmandatory recitations and youre good 
Professor Art is an amazing professor His lectures are very clear and interesting The workload is fair exams and assignments are graded by TAs so it all depends on them 
Davit Art is a genius He has two quizzes a midterm a paper and a final as the only grades in his class Go to the optional sections They are incredibly helpful The readings are dense but if you stay caught up he goes over them in class Otherwise you may be kind of lost The readings are also really interestingMy favorite class ever 
Art is a fantastic teacher I had him for Comparative Politics and it was a lot of fun There are a lot of readings in the class but he also gives a chance for students to participate and have a discussion The midterm does not require to do all the readings The midterm includes to write about one reading in length HE IS AWESOME  
Such a nice guy Prof Art is a great teacher w extensive knowledge and credibility in his field yet respects and addresses even the most basic questionscomments from students Knew all of the students by name and encouraged discussion without letting the ramblers get out of hand tough but fair grader dont leave Tufts wout taking his class 
Art is a very solid teacher Hes passionate about the material and it shows Theres a fair amount of reading but nothing outrageous and its mostly interesting The class is based on a lot of discussion which really helps to understand the material Work consisted of  exams a short paper  pages and a longer paper  pages Recommended 
Class was interesting but a lot of reading Prof Art is a nice guy and his lectures are usually very helpful in that he directly summarizes the reading He seemed a little out of his comfort zone and his lectures were less clear in discussing Political Economy Grading seemed too focused on spewing facts rather than good argumentswriting 
Art is a great professor He manages an intro class very well if youre interested in poli sci youll enjoy this class Do the readings go to the sections and youll do well There are two quizzes a midterm a paper and a final Theres a lot to read and its not easy stuff especially if youre a freshman but its certainly worth it 
Interesting class interesting teacher Readings often start out very interesting and become long and repetitive Art knows the topic very well and the exams are very fair Readings are not mandatory but make sure you understand the gist of all of them Paper only requires detailed knowledge of one reading Overall good class but pretty hard 
As one of Prof Arts former students at Holy Cross I can tell you that this man knows his stuff Extremely helpful very clear in lectures and in the time he was at HC he was one of the easier graders in the Poli Sci dept Highly Recommended Take his classes if at all possible 
Prepare to take a ton of notes and to do a lot of reading but his class is extremely good and you definitely learn a lot Not much graded material so examsquizzes are very important and you cant do well on them without doing the readings He teaches well and is highly knowledgeable Id definitely recommend him as a professor

Fantastic professor makes difficult material engaging Hes extremely personable and will know your name very quickly Highly advise his courses for anyone whether youre just fulfilling a social science requirement or intend on majoring in poli sci 
This is a difficult but rewarding course Professor Art is really passionate about his subject He packs a ton of information into his lectures but theyre very organized There is a TON of dense reading and almost all of it is necessary to do well in the course Quizzes and exams are all essays based on the reading Irina his TA is amazing 
Professor Art is an amazing teacher He really likes what he is teaching and he tries to pass that on to his students Most importantly though he doesnt force anything on people He encourages students to think for themselves The last day of class he asks everyone Does this course have any value Decide for yourself Awesome professor 
DArts class is great As a freshman it was so hard to understand the whole concept of comp pol at first but his readings are truly exceptional at clarifying how its all relevant and united Study hard from section notes AKA know it front and back examsquizzes are very specific and TAs are tough graders and talk to TAs

Really great guy Made chem  lab totally doable Total hottie with a great personality Very helpful in recitations and office hours I hope he is a TA for chem  
Often falls behind and hard to follow at times during lectureGives great notes however that help to clarify materials being taught but you do need to spend significant amount of time on your own to understand and practice problems He really does care for his students despite his small flaws HILARIOUS in class also  
He seems to give no time to the most difficult subjects and then rambles on easy 
He is very good 
very nice friendly and his excitement is clear it was a pleasure working with Sam Kim although he is not always the clearest very nice and always tries to help 
I thought he was a great teacher i learned more than i have learned in most econ classes and he made it very easy to understand 
Doesnt go over questions on homework like other math professors Still manages to get behind goes into extreme detail which makes it confusing Have to teach yourself everything from the textbook to even do the homework 
Falls behind in every class If i didnt have the student solutions manual i would have been lost on the homework Has an accent but talks slow enough to be able to understand 
After I stopped attending this class my grade went up significantly He doesnt cover nearly enough in class I suggest teaching yourself from the book which is mediocre as well but understandable 
Hes been teaching this class for  years so there are no mistakes in the textbook and lab packet which he wrote There are no mistakes Tests are hard but curved so dont worry too much Hes not super clear and easy to follow in lecture but work through stuff on your own and youll come out knowing your stuff Hes a really great guy 
If youre a physics major dont take this class Its not required for your major you probably wont do well in it and you have to compete with Engineers who have studied this material before for the grade curve Test averages were in the s 
Terrible teacher mumbles doesnt speak and when we asked him to put a microphone he put it on his collar and he still doesnt talk in it except when he turns to the board to write something and you shriek in pain because all of a sudden you have his voice ampified a billion times 
A great class not easy but small setting and professor is always there for extra help and very interesting materials Fun lab if you like to build things 
I actually thought Oliver was a pretty good professor used a lot of effort to know each students name encouraged students to give tips on how to make classrecitation more efficient Methodical at teaching the material reminds of us relationship bw new and old material always guides students along instead of lecturing nonstop 
This was an amazing class The work load was really light and I learned so much The class doesnt focus so much on history of western music as good listening and analysis skills Gil is funny and engaging and encourages really great discussion Intro to Western Music was one of the best classes I have taken at Tufts 
Hes House Laidback friendly sarcastic and bemused very passionate How can you not love him 
Great class Super easy arts credit homework basically consists of maybe listening to one piece a week Gil is hilarious too 
Gil has an easygoing personality easy to talk to decently funny sarcastic during rehearsals However seems to be lacking as a conductor Instead of using different techniques to fix a passage he only tells us whats missing and makes us play passages over and overNeeds to work on conducting through teaching not teaching through conducting 
Love him 
Still funny the class is still interesting and I actually enjoyed the material But what happened to him being easy I did well on both midterms A only missed one class and submitted all homework assignments Guess what I ended up getting B Emailed him for a response two weeks ago and did not get a reply yet

Love Sommers He is so funny and engaging even in a boring class He seems eager to help and meet with students outside of class although he is a very busy man 
He wrote a book called situations matter It basically tells you what you figured out in th grade about context guiding behavior Great teacher if you like stories and examples about how bad we should feel for having a cerebral cortex In general arrogant and relies too much on anecdote Not sure if hes a scientist or just a lecturer

He was an excellent teacher and was willing to help you any time you were having prolems

Boghosian is amazing 
He is an amazing lecturer Things that I learned in his nonlinear PDE class are still useful for my research after years He is extremely helpful and very nice in interacting with the students The home works are heavy but that is basically the nature of the course and the only way to learn the material I rate him as the best professor Ive had

Prof Boghosian is a wonderful professor and a brilliant man but Math  is ridiculously difficult He teaches well but the subject matter is abstract at times and requires a lot of work to understand The homework was terribly long complicated and difficult The tests were hard but fair Great class if youre willing to put the effort into it

A really good professor Make no mistake this is hard class  but the prof did a good job of bringing in real examples and applying the theory to real world examples I would say this section is not the easy way out but the way to really learn something useful And yes hes a sharp dresser 
I have to disagree with most of the other reviews Though this class is not a walk in the park Dehejia is more than willing to help you in and out of class whenever you have questions Micro is inherently a dense subject but Dehejia has a unique wittiness that allows him to convey the subject matter in a more appealing manner than most professors 
He makes the subject impossible by using examples that are extremely difficult to follow in class He is very smart but is incapable of communicating key concepts His problem sets and readings do not prepare you for the level of difficulty in tests 
One of the hardest classses Ive taken at Tufts and turned me off from majoring in economics The textbook was horrible and examples in class were completely unrelated Online problem sets which counted for  of the grade were not too difficult but were nothing like the exams The final exam counted for  of the grade and was nearly impossibl 
Professor Dehejia is probably the least effective professor Ive encountered at Tufts Hes obviously smart but only communicates the necessary material at the most cursory elementary level making it difficult for students to extrapolate their knowledge  especially on exams I would not take another class with him Welldressed

Professor Strong is an inspirational teacher whose laidback style of teaching allows for greater creativity and softer constructive criticism I would love to have a class with him again 
Rather than reading each others stories and then commenting We read them out loud in class and immediately give feedback This results in very little useful feedback This is exasperated by Strong who encourages speculation on what future pages will hold Finally Strong loves teenage angst driven romances Anything else is shallow without depth

Strong requires you to write a lot but you dont have to finish stories The focus is on the process of creation chiefly the creation of authentic recognizable characters In the class you read stories aloud and then discuss characterplot The fiction you will write will be realistic No fantasyscifi Strong is kind and helpful a great guy 
Awesome very friendly and always gives very constructive comments 
This was by far the worst class I have taken at Tufts and I LOVE writing Strong does not know what he is talking about He shuns any original ideas and instead tries to class to turn into a homogeneous lump of teenage romance stories The only stories of mine he liked were the ones I made intentionally horrendous but about teenage love 
Took Intermediate Writing with Prof Strong He was a good teacher but my biggest complaint was his refusal to let students read each others work Instead we read the stories out loud in class His comments were more plotrelated than about style or things that he did or dint like but he was a fair grader 
best prof at tufts so sweet and honest 
Interesting and fun Very helpful and perceptive 
Writes a lot on the board but its all useful I liked that he explained everything clearly and conceptually but also did practice problems really nice and approachable I recommend going to his office hours 
Amazing at explaining things Good handwriting easy to follow in class

Scott is great  approachable friendly and a great lecturer who lays out his expectations for his students clearly I would take another class with him given the chance 
Awesome professor who makes himself available to all students Hes a smart guy and gives students the opportunity to work with a company all semester No marketing experience before the class but came out knowing so much more 
Marketing use to be known as one of the best classes of minor until Professor Derby began teaching Now the class is just boring and filled with unnecessary lectures that go on with no point Stay away from Professor Derby and only hope ELS department does the right thing and remove him from the ELS department before you need to take this class 
CARING 
AMAZING LECTURES 
INSPIRATIONAL 
Theres a reason Jack Derby has Twice been Tufts University teacher of the year He cares so much about his students and is willing to commit so much time to see them succeed in life His whole mojo is that he trains his students to take high paying jobs and hes incredibly committed to making that happen Not just a great teacher a great person 
I am several years removed but I am still amazed at how Mr Derby who consistently exaggerates his success garners so much adulation at Tufts He is certainly not a tremendous business success which I have confirmed and am happy to share my findings Perhaps the better question why is he gloating instead of teaching 
Best class at Tufts The class works in small teams and does marketing for actual entrepreneurial companies so although theres a lot of work to be done its an incredible opportunity and a great experience 
this class was the bomb best class ive taken at tufts 
Hands on experience working with real companies was helpful 
Professor Derbys marketing class was a lot of fun but also a lot of work It was scary to hear what our project was going to be at the beginning of the semester but ended up being fun and interesting The class gave me some experience dealing with people in the corporate world Also Professor Derby will try and help any student in any situation 
CARING 
I never understood how does he juggle it all He always emails back right away 
Prof Derby truly cares about the progress of his students and effectively creates an environment that resembles real world senarios This is the most beneficial class Ive taken at Tufts for a future career in businessfinance and is a business course If you want to engage with real companies and management while still in college take it 
The class that Professor Derby has set up is the most unique experience that I have been a part of in my college career You work in groups with real companies and solve sales and marketing issues that potentially make real impact in the lives of those companies The companies are clients of Derbys management business So its a winwin all around 
Jack is one of the best professors at Tufts His classes are engaging and stimulating He treats you as if you are his business partner and priortizes your learning as such The experience of working with a real company for the final marketing project is invaluable Take the class 
This course is based on the Astanga tradition a powerful style of yoga Be prepared to sweat Elliott introduces the sequence with awareness and compassion  providing opportunities for you to be challenged and listen to your body He always made time to answer questions offer suggestions and guidance upon request and his welcoming personality ma 
Elliot is the man An incredible yogi and an excellent passionate teacher His understanding of the poses is profound and he always knows how to verbally assist a student clearly and effectively Also a really nice guy and I felt entirely comfortable when he gave handson assistance in class Just show up if its full hell definitely let you in

PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
INSPIRATIONAL 
Elliott understands that many of his students are beginners and tailors his class properly I felt pushed in every class but not to a point where things felt impossible He only allows  absences in the entire semester which is inconvenient If you dont try he may not like you Hes sternly talked to people during class who were lying down 
I did alot of yoga prior to this class and I was a little bit turned off by the end of the semester He says that youll sweat alot during class bc youre working hard but really he just turns the heat up He is a very good yogi and helpful but sometimes came across as arrogant Should allow for more absences given that its a PE class 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
As a certified yoga instructor I found his attitude very distressing He makes snide comments that just dont sit right In my opinion he couldve done a much better job teaching beginner students the basics and safety without being condescending about it He doesnt set up students for success very well 
Wants you to do well cares about his students Very smart guy 
Hilarious very cool brilliant guy

Professor Borgers is a great guy and is a really caring teacher It is obvious that he is passionate both about his scholarly studies and about his students He is always willing to meet and give extra help whether during office hours or over email However he does move quite quickly his online quizzes are tricky but only worth  of the grade

Great teacher and great guy wants everyone to do well takes the time to meet with you and answer emails if youre stuck 
Entertaining funny professor but moves VERY quickly Very open to help during office hours and sends lots of clarification emails Im not a math person but I enjoyed this class 
Christoph is the best german math teacher ever and he has the cutest lisp If it werent for all the stupid kids in that class it would be a joy every time ask him to do a Schwarzenegger impression 
Some of the material was hard and his explanations werent always clear but he was very helpful in office hours 
Borgers was one of the best profs Ive had at Tufts so far Really cares about students understanding the material very open to questions in and out of class and is a genuinely nice and funny guy Awesome 
Great professor Very clear Very dedicated Always there for extra help 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA 
RESPECTED 
Decent professor but when you start the homework you realize his lectures didnt quite cut it 
First year teaching the class Lectures barely made any sense homeworks were impossible even after lecture Showed virtually no interest in teaching the class Was extremely condescending at times 
Ryder isnt the worst person ever but hes pretty bad  wasnt overly difficult but assignments were erratic and you mostly have to figure it out yourself Not an enjoyable class but not going to kill you 
The class was not hard in terms of concepts but the test were definitely harder than the hw so be prepared also do the textbook problems because test questions are sometimes taken from there 
TOUGH GRADER 
He doesnt seem very interested in teaching the class which makes this fundamentals class really boring Goes through math in examples really quickly in his slides and doesnt post them Problem sets are either fine or too difficult Tests are also all over the place If you like the concepts you should end up fine 
Numerical Methods was an easy course despite the homework taking around  hours a week He got the hang of using the lab to show us his work near the end of the semester Solid teacher wants everyone to get an A 
Hard Prof but really cares if you do well Work hard and itll be fine 
Its too bad he has no enthusiasm for what he does He seems like hes in utter hell when hes teaching One on one he was fine but his demeanor really hindered my learning Smart guy otherwise 
You probably wont mind ryder if you do well but if you are struggling he will be a huge pain Never responds to emails and puts minimal effort into your learning He makes me feel like I am worth nothing and not smart enough to be a chem e He should not be allowed to teach the introductory course Not even very helpful oneonone 
need to seriously consider retirement id say early retirement but i think were way past that point lab lecture is incredibly boring and not to mention completly pointless 
Stolow is caring but he is a horrible professor The entire class is on their cell phones during class and he goes through tedious power points If he runs out of material hell just read the textbook until the end of class Additionally his tests are ridiculously and unnecessarily difficult and the grading is stingy Would not recommend 
TOUGH GRADER 
Professor Stolow might be a cool guy but I would never take a class with him again I had him for Orgo lab lecture and you have to go because of quizzes at the end of class but they are a waste of time and almost nobody pays attention There are practice quizzes nice but one small mistake on quizzes and you will get a  or  on the quiz 
Very Helpful and very concerned about students process He is willing to spend his time  hoursweek to organize review sessions for various topics 
I have learned nothing from Stolow Everything I understand is because of the book During his lectures he spends too much time talking about tiny details and then wont give you enough time to copy down the important things during the lecture 
This professor needs to seriously consider retiring Hes boring and lecture are useless for the most part He gives you practice exams but wont give you the answers to help you study NOT HELPFUL Tests are way harder than practice exams be warned 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Stolow was definitely the worst professor Ive ever had He was very unreceptive to students questions never responded to emails and his lectures were hard to follow He would sometimes also quiz us on information unrelated to what we had learned in lab lectures or even in the corresponding organic chemistry class 
Awful Just awful Worst professor Ive ever had Poor explainer nitpicky grader and boring He occasionally flashes some charm or a bit of a sense of humor but I would much rather have had someone who could actually teach orgo than occasionally be charming 
A sweet guy actually wants to teach you but really too old and sometimes forgets things 
Nice person slow teaching Too slow 
Horrible just reads the textbook in class does not teach 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
TOUGH GRADER 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Stolow is an incredibly intelligent professor but can be hard to follow in lecture due to being a slow talker If you pay attention during his lectures he can be quite engaging and funny You will get a lot out if it and labs will be much easier as a result Make sure to look at practice lab quizzes before class or your lab quiz grade is screwed 
Professor Stolow does show concern for his students understanding He will schedule review sessions way in advance and will try to give studying tips constantly The problem isthe review sessions are not always helpful He takes too long on one problem and you may miss doing three other problems because of it Okay that would be totally fine if 
Good professor sometimes is very boring but if you pay close attention he randomly really funny and entertaining Keep up with the work in this class or your screwed 
Be prepared to teach yourself everything or spend a load of money on a tutor Do yourself a favor and just take organic with  another professor or  at another school 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK

GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK 
The depth of knowledge learned from Chem  has served me well in  years of Pharma and Biotech Jobs This is miserably difficult because no assignment is accepted until everything is correct Professor Stolow just keeps giving it back until you get it right Tough love but you will get it right in the real world 
TOUGH GRADER 
Lectures were basically useless and quizzes were difficult esoteric and tedious with little to no partial credit People have said hes incredibly smart but I couldnt hear enough of the monotone lecture to get anything to talk about 
TOUGH GRADER 
Before I took Stolows class an upperclassman had advised me not to take Orgo with Stolow I wish I had heeded that advice Stolow is a HORRIBLE lecturer who DOESNT TEACH If you are reading this my advice would be to take Orgo with anyone else 
awful boring unable to teach just reads the textbook extremely picky grader 
Really is a terrible professor  go over information sparsely in class and only goes into detail on the exams and refuses to scale 
GET READY TO READ 
LECTURE HEAVY 
I had Stolow for lab lecture and he is a brilliant man but it is EXTREMELY hard to hear him and so its really easy to doze off in his lecture Nice man very helpful but he is incredibly verbose and technical and monotonous which makes it hard to pay attention He also stopped posting answer keys to the practice quizzes which wasnt nice 
Excellent professor Stolows a boss Hes difficult but youll learn a lot 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Horribly long lectures that did not help in neither the quizzes nor the labs themselves Everyone was online during each lecture because paying attention wasnt necessary but attendance was because there was a quiz at the end of each lecture 
Good class 
Tads great really enjoyed him as a professor However be warned that he is a HARD GRADER 
Great teacher Fairly easy class Quizzes everyday that are on the readings which are minimal and interesting Tests are right off the slides Easy A 
The professor is fair and kind and seems like he knows the area very well Also he is relatively young so he relates to us students Cons he can be a bit harsh in his grading 
Crazy helpful Always around and always knows how to help with research designs and analyses I seriously dont know what I would have done without all of his help Definitely recommend taking a class with him as a TA 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
I really dont like this guy He wastes insane amounts of time giving an unnecessary number of examples for everything he says and wants everyone to participate even though its a huge class Boring and dry material when I thought it could be really interesting 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
CARING 
TOUGH GRADER 
Puts a lot of time and energy into the students a great mentor for students in the eng psych major though hes not usually on site at Tufts Can help you find an internship has a lot of connections I wish we could have him as an advisor but hes adjunct professor or something 
Dr B cares about his students has tons of scientific knowledge and does a nice job explaining things with examples If youre an EngPsych major youll have to take both of his classes Good stuff though second semester he makes everyone do weekly presentations so that sucks 
Decent professor but he goes over my head once in a while Shows a lot of math logarithmic functions and other nonsensical things that a liberal arts student like myself finds confusing Ill take his class next semester but ask him to go slow through the numbers jk 
fun engaging  keeps lectures interesting better than most other ENP and HF profs who can be boring and dry and get stuck on certain topics like air traffic control over and over and over again material not very exciting but at least you get to choose your own materials in advanced class always on email like always really 
Dr Brunye is pretty neat his lectures and projects put me on the edge of my seat When I suggest classes for my friends to take I say take his for heavens sake

Overall I think hes a great professor who really cares about whether students understand the course content and do well on the quizzes and exams The material is great and he gives a ton of examples and anecdotes to help drive home the points You have to come to class and participate its a BIG part of your grade I suggest taking his classes 
Very good  smart professor but goes too fast in classand you can get lost if you dont pay close attention to detailshe is also a hard grader but if you go talk to him he will try to help you out 
I loved this professor His presentation of the material is crystal clear hes openly available outside of class for help His philosophy of teaching is very good 
a true classic Roarin Denny has the unmistakeable character of what a great professor should be One of my favorites 
This mans best days are definitely behind him He struggles to solve his own problems that HE wrote however many years ago that was It was astonishing to watch I get the sense that hes just waiting for Tufts to send him to pasture since hed lose tenure if he just quit Either that or hes going senile Avoid at all costs 
Hes the man 
Good teacher overall kinda quirky but you get used to him Teaches you what he expects you to know and nothing else His weaknesses are forgetfulness and ability to go through problems and get the right answer with ease the first time 
READ READ READ and you will do well I didnt read half of his lectures and didnt do that well B 
Difficult professor  unclear what he wants on essays and a very harsh grader Would not recommend 
contd He includes interesting videos and jokes in his lectures He organises all his lecture points clearly on a handout He offers to read through essay drafts and his comments clarifies his expectations well If you follow all his comments on your draft you should do well He is prompt on returning homework 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
SO MANY PAPERS 
Friendly prof especially in office hours but very strange about essay grading criteria and gives super unclear prompts I was able to get a good grade but it was a process of stress trying to somehow discern what he wanted last minute emailing and freaking out in office hours Very nice to talk to though and does want his students to succeed 
Definitely knows his material and is very helpful easygoing etc Assigns very interesting readings Some may consider his speaking style to be boring The only problem is that he tends to give longwinded answers to questions asked during discussions but if you can get past that hes a very good teacher 
The material could be interesting but he is pretty boring There is a ton of reading for comparative politics but not all of it has too be done He goes over a lot in class but is not clear so notetaking can be confusing He is very devoted to the course which is good 
I love this guy DemCapt in Japan is amazing The course is SO informative and fascinating on culture history politics of East Asia and Fuj is hilarious and keeps it interesting He gives multiple grading opportunities  not common for a PS course at Tufts  and is really understanding about extensions and such Dont miss this class 
A very good professor who is very knowledgeable He is really passionate about what he teaches Although it was formatted as a lecture he encouraged much discussion being deliberate about leaving time for it and engaging seriously with students points 
GET READY TO READ 
TOUGH GRADER 
Not the best of Tufts PS department Harsh grader and does not know how to design good essay questions He has not let us out on time a single time this semester Does not know how to structure class time well Discussions are you just parroting the readings and not actually thinkingdiscussing Content is interesting but I cant recommend 
I took Fujihiras comparative politics class during the summer as a highschooler It was interesting engaging and well taught nevertheless the courseload seemed excessive The class felt as if all the material from the semester class was crammed into a  week regiment Still Fujihira is a wonderful Grade wise it seems as if maybe  got As 
He is an excelent professor I found him extremely knowledgable in the Comparative Politics course and perticurally so on South Asia as that is his area of concentration The reading load is heavy though worth it and the lectures always in a structured powerpoint really help make sense of them He was helpful insightful organized  flexible 
fujihira is a good lecturer organized and extremely knowledgeable but he tends to allow certain members of the class to dominate the discussion also his TAs are all huge pricks but fujihira is a genuinely nice guy who will be a big help if you seek him out 
pretty good professor knows his stuff well powerpoints contain all the information most of the exam questions are given to you beforehand so no reason anyone cant get an A or B in the class 
He is a great professor He cares about his students and does want to make sure everyone suceeds He prepares you well for the exams and the class is very interesting Also everything is on blackboard if you miss a class 
I went to less than  of lectures and got an A TAs are an amazing resource and outline everything you need to write on the tests DHFeldman takes himself so seriously and I didnt realize until the last theory that he is a really big deal I loved his bookideas and have a lot of respect for him He has a lot of respect for students as well 
Great class in the sense that youre required to go out and learn a new skill ie swimming ASL juggling which is really cool It is a TON of work to do journal entries every week and its easy to forget to do them He IS a bit longwinded which is frustrating at times but hes brilliant and really nice He wants to help his students too 
Amazing professor learned so much 
fundamentally interesting material with a tiresome lecturer not a great combo 
Feldman does not lecture he rambles Time taken going to lecture would be better spent staying home and perhaps reading the material instead Work An  week project hrs expected weekly work written Journal entry each week Ending with a  page paper  essay quizzes an essay final Let me save you the trouble Dont take this course 
Boring lecturer but I found the material interesting Wants to see his students do well 
he posts the lecture power points so you dont necessarily need to go to class but he says a lot in class that isnt on the slides Its pretty much impossible to follow him though Exams are easy if you memorize the terms and plan out your essays you know what will be on the exam before you take it 
Boring lecturer Completely incomprehensible and impossible to follow Lecture slides posted online Test questions given before test 
Professor Feldman is really a great person he is very eager to help students understand material and is enthusiastic about course material His lectures can be somewhat confusing but he is good at highlighting key points Tests are essay format but are given out in advance To get an A you must get about a  but its completely doable 
Interesting class but like everyone says has a HUGE ego Lots of time spent learning about his own theory on intellectual development other than that hes a passionate professor and tries to make things interesting tests are difficult to study for final paper is long and tediousyoull have a written inclass final in addition to the paper 
very smart sweet man lectures are so boring but class is kind of a joke not hard at all 
Prof Feldman is a wierd guy he seems really nice one day but will give you the cold shoulder the next Tests are hard to study for but easy when you take them A LOT of writing and a huge paper and project takes up a lot of your time Doable class but annoying that it is required 
Amazing teacher so adorable and is intersted in makin sure that everyone suceeds 
Professor Feldman is very knowledgeable about the subject matter However his metahobby project panters more to his ego than anything else My advice is to take his creativity class and avoid Advanced Intellectual Development 
CARING 
INSPIRATIONAL 
Truly an amazing professor teaching a fantastic class Take this class There is a good amount of reading but it is so worth it and even if you dont do all the reading pay attention in class because Prof Feldmans words are gold He is such a respected and leading figure in the field and he is so passionate about what he is teaching  amazing 
Biggest mistake of my life was taking this class It is without a doubt the worst class I have ever taken The metahobby assignment is thoroughly ridiculous and unnecessarily long His lectures dont make any sense I think he just teaches this class to talk about his own theory and collect evidence for his research to support his own theory 
At least the material is interesting Although Feldman is clearly passionate about his lectures he is impossible to follow He gets stuck on a particular point and much of the lecture becomes redundant The tests are fairly easy and the workload is manageable Also he has a huge ego it can either grossly annoy or grossly amuse you 
Feldman is SO adorable He absolutely LOVES what he does and has so many interesting stories about his experience in the field He can talk in circles sometimes often so classes can seem a bit boring but his enthusiasm and interest makes it worth it Also he gives you the exam questions ahead of time so the exams are not too bad 
Feldman is incredibly nice and wants everyone to do well If you are at all interested in the material the class is great Long and sometimes hard readingsbut Feldman and the TAs do so much to make it easier 
I loved Feldman Hes such a good resource and hes one of the most knowledgeable professors we have Brilliant guy Talk to him and get to know him because he really wants his students to succeed 
Western Political Thought is the hardest class Ive ever taken at Tufts  and it is by far the best one Both lectures and readings challenge your world view in a way that will make you a different person when you finish the class He is a complete genius a complete nut and one of the most interesting teachers Ive ever had 
By far the best professor at Tufts He knows the material inside and out and makes sure you understand some very dense readings Youll do fine if you read listen and take notes It is impossible to get bored during his lectures thanks to his hysterical personal anecdotes and guided class discussions You will find yourself look forward to class 
He comes off as loud and intimidating but is actually soft and approachable Loves his work Difficult readings at times but not difficult to do well

Nice guy but you either understand the material or you dont If you dont just take the L and try your best 
Devigne is one of the professors that made choosing what i want to study at tufts clear to me Takes a heavy subject like political theory and makes it relatable to noobies Very funny very charismatic and allows discussion of the material frequently in class Papers are difficult but allow room for your own interpretation 
RESPECTED 
HILARIOUS

Someone earlier compared Devigne to Lewis Blackcould not agree more There was no daily work and the entire grade was based on the midterm takehome paper and the final takehome Lectures were entertaining and the readings were incredible 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
TOUGH GRADER 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Devigne is a funny guy However his lectures are impossible to understand and he illegible takes notes on a legal pad and projects them onto the screen He abbreviates EVERY word on his notes so unless you hear him read the notes out loud you cant make heads or tails of them The entire class is graded on  papers which youre  days to write 
Perhaps he should stop letting his TAs grade papers  they only think something is quotrightquot if it came from the mouth of The Great Devigne Oh and if you think swearing isnt appropriate for a college prof avoid King Robert 
Devigne is amazing he is brilliant and funny He grades fairly and his classes deal with fundamental topics He is humble and confident and really cares that his students care 
Decent lecturer and funny The only problem is the tests Grades are based solely on two papers and there is no room for your own ideas  dont write it if he didnt say it in class unless youre ok getting a C

WPT II with Devigne was one of the hardest classes Ive taken at Tufts with frenzied unfollowable lectures and two very strictly graded takehome exams While Devigne is a crazy genius and is very funny his feedback was never useful writing things like awful in sections that needed improvement Would be cautious before taking this class 
Professor Devigne is a superb teacher 
I loved PS but this class is totally different He is an awesome prof when you have him for a big class but not a small class He comes off as way more abrasive and not so helpful I often left confused and unhappy and even though he encourages coming to office hours I found him intimidating 
GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
I love Devigne Rise  Decay of the West was a challenging but really interesting class He really knows his stuff and really wants the class to understand the material The whole grade is the midterm and the final no other assignments besides reading Hes also hilarious 
Awesome 
Devigne is a genius He is a crazy teacher with so much charisma never a dull moment in class He is engaging and exciting and makes the class very relevant Hardest class Ive ever taken but got the most out of it 
Devignes notes are an adventure dont expect to be able to look at the board for help its like a Pollock but hes brilliant one of my favorite classes yet 
Good guy knows his politics and pretty helpful despite the most scattered class notes Ive ever seen Huge class dont need to go to all the lectures but in lecture he tells you what parts of the books are important Grade consisted of a Midterm and a Final like  pgs each 
good class devigne isnt necessarily the clearest professor in the world scattered board notes but hes very enthusiastic and funny 
Have you ever wanted to take a class with Lewis Black as your professor but unable to as Lewis Black is not actually a teacher Well youre in luck This man screams all his material much like Mr Black and comes complete with shoulder shrug and hand waving action 
Best lecturer Ive ever had Hes hilarious and so clear with the material Too bad I wasnt that interested in Western Political Thought  
Professor Devigne is cold arrogant and very unhelpful In office hours hes downright insulting as if you are only there to try and raise your grade If you are confused its your fault according to him no matter how much effort you put in and hes not responsible 
hardcore dude 
Knows his stuff but you must know his stuff on papers or else you wont do well Has lead an interesting life and he will tell you all about it in class 
He is such a good teacher He goes through everything you need to know for the midterm and finals He seems intimidating and scary at first but hes actually a really nice guy 
He is the best 
Best class I have ever taken 
fabulous teacher swears a lot really funny 
just like all the polisci professors hes an arrogant genius 
Knows his stuff but doesnt relay it well Youll come out of class and not know the most important parts of lectures If I hadnt taken good notes I would have done poorly Definetly amusing though 
I learned a dickload of material in this class and changed my major to Philosophy because the material and Devigne are SO INSPIRING Plus hes from the Bronx my parents are from the Bronx too so that alone seperates him from the rest of the vanilla waffer suburbian rabble at Tufts 
devigne is neoconservative  
Fantastic course The lectures are very interesting but can be difficult to follow Office hours and study sessions are helpful 
great professor great class I learned alot and did well without really working that hard as long as you go to class doing the readings isnt too important leectures are always amusing if unorganized at times 
Devigne is one of the most interesting and intriguing professors I have ever encountered His lectures and their enthusiasm make the intense reading assignments worth it He is funny and quirky Hard material lots of reading devigne makes it worth it 
Fun course but you really cant afford to miss a class Hes a great lecturer and a pretty funny guy  but you do need to pay attention to catch it all Hardly any assignments easy tests  a nice way to break up your schedule 
A nice easy class Hes very clear and easy to understand and is always willing to clarify any questions you have Beware though at the end of every semester he goes into panic mode because the end of the course is nearing and tries to teach everything at once 
Excellent class he is genuinely concerned that all his students fully understand everything he teaches His midterm and final are both really easy and the subject is very different and fun 
Nice guy but one class a week of ASL is not enough to learn the language Two tests midterm and final are rather obscure but there is no other work Class is fun and interesting 
Jim is the man Seriously take this class it will change your experience at Tufts completely His tests arent hard and not getting an A is truly difficult An unbelievable amount of respect for this guy He really cares and tries to teach you as much as he can Amazing class cant wait for ASL  
Incredibly challenging course But very interesting material if youre interested in probabilitystatsmath He curves the grades at the end a LOT so dont despair if you struggle Really great professor 
TEST HEAVY 
EXTRA CREDIT 
CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA 
Prof Miller claims to be available for questions anytime his office door is open but he is not welcoming and his attitude makes it very clear that you are wasting his time Exams are graded generously though and he scaled the overall course grade up by  points at the end I did fine in the class just reading the textbook and skipping class 
Eric Miller is a great professor This class was HARD and he covered material quickly but if you attend every class and study what he covers you will do fine on the exams If you want an easy ride take ES instead if you want to learn the material take EE with Miller 
HILARIOUS 
TOUGH GRADER 
After Professor Miller handed out the second midterm test in our graduate computer vision class he quietly said to the class let the gentle weeping commence If you like being challenged  even to the point of discomfort this is a professor you will love Stay away if youre just here to check a box 
GET READY TO READ 
His course is quite interesting I quite enjoy his course and assignment However he is a very young lecturerI think  is his first year to teach And I have to say he lacks teaching experience The syllabus lacks arrangements So the second halfsemester is quite busy But I think he will become better in the future 
GROUP PROJECTS 
EXTRA CREDIT 
Prof Bell does not give timely or sufficient feedback on assignments  at one point I had submitted over seven assignments that he had yet to grade One assignment took him over two months to grade Furthermore his calculation of the overall course grade was veiled I have no way to check his calculation Overall frustrating to work for

Lots of homework but I learned a lot and really enjoyed the class Main assignments were writing and revising  screenplays approx  pages writing weekly screening reports for short films and readings Inclass workshops werent very helpful but he gives great feedback during office hours Highly recommend 
Im so conflicted by Khary I would recommend taking a class with him he is a true genius in the field but be ready for a rollercoaster of understanding When you get feedback from him or meet oneonone you come out with a remarkable understanding of what you need to do but often you have no idea what is expected from you He tortured genius

LOTS OF HOMEWORK

Professor Korman was very condescending when students did not immediately understand concepts in his class Would not recommend taking the class with him unless you absolutely must 
The material for Algorithms should not be that complicated but somehow Matias makes it feel unbearably hard I recently learned the only way I can do well on the homeworks is to go to office hours with  other kids who have no idea what is going on where TAs essentially give you the answers Would not recommend this prof for this course 
Ive had Matias for comp and now  Matias is a nice guy and it seemed that many of the problems in  were just from him being new Now having him for  though the class is bad I and others Ive talked to struggle to follow his lectures at allcreating a lot of extra work for material that by itself does not need to be difficult

LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
Lectures while not great are generally helpful until the end of the semester Self teaching was almost mandatory on harder concepts Homework seemed to have an almost arbitrary difficulty curve with some assignments requiring lots of time being followed by substantially easier ones or an occasional extreme ramp up in difficulty 
Rambly and not the best but not too bad He seemed like he was still getting his footing at Tufts and you could tell he knew a lot especially when he talked about his research The course itself is mostly graded by TAs and the learning comes from the assignments so his teaching isnt really the important component of the course imo do the hw 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
Matias is nice and the workload is what should be expected out of a COMP class which is a lot His lectures are really boring though but overall the class is not too bad Office hours with the TAs are a big help 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
GET READY TO READ 
Powerpoints were very vague and mostly had no code on them The professor seemed confused at times about the content he was teaching You would benefit from learning the material on your own rather than paying attention to his lectures Spend lots of time on the homework and ask lots of clarifying questions to the TAs as criteria can be confusing 
Just reads off the slides and doesnt really explain the concepts Hard to follow Course is cotaught with Mark Sheldon and Ive learned way more in Sheldons lectures 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
TOUGH GRADER 
Very unclear in lecture and on homeworks 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
He was an awful professor Very unorganized both in the organization of class and the organization of lectures Snarky and does not receive feedback well Bad at explaining concepts find a good TA or look up stuff online Start hw early and its not that bad but the class was way more work than it had been in previous years with a different prof 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
Matias is a nice guy BUT he fails to teach effectively This is because his slides do not follow clear progression and are unclear  this also applies to the way he teaches Plus his handwriting is barely legible The class isnt horrible though  he knows its hard and does care for his students He puts in extra hours and helps in office hours 
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
CARING 
Not sure why all the others are so scathing  Mati is so so caring about his students and hes always willing to help outside of lectures if necessary Its obvious that hes really passionate about CS and hell always want to help you out if you care enough about the subject

AMAZING LECTURES 
My favorite class so farand it met for  hours Monday night Lectures were engaging fun and very informative He really made everything clear and graded easy Open note  open book exams He also exposed me to lots of helpful resources at Tufts  PS If you ever mention anything related to New Hampshire youll score major points 
prof hannon is a really great teachergenuinely cares about his students hes really busy though because he actually works in the field so its pretty tough to get ahold of him but classes are easy and interesting homework assignments arent bad at all tests are easy 
Great guy advisor and lecturer Should be the head of the ENP department

Professor Hannon is a very nice professor who is extremely respected in his field of Human Factors Mechanical Engineering He always tells you exactly what he expects is a fair grader and is always willing to help The class is hit or miss on the workload Sometimes you have three projects at once and sometimes you dont have any work for weeks 
This is a great class Prof Hannon can be a very interesting guy and he has a really cool life Hes very easy going about deadlines almost but not quite to a fault He has really interesting ideas 
I really enjoyed his lecture style

LECTURE HEAVY 
CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA 
Great professor Lots of reading Biweekly lectures that run from start to end Prepare to take notes VERY long exams multiple choice heavy and open answer Covers about  chapters at once Hes a great guy 
Make sure you do the reading hes very smart and if the class keeps up he has tons of stories to tell Too bad he wont be teaching this spring 
Very hard grader Expects an insane amount of work for a lower level elective The problem is that he is so knowledgeable and expects the same level of knowledge from his students Mainly looks for data on paper and expects lots of abstract knowledge I definitely regret taking his class damaged my GPA 
Hes a complete tool The material is interesting but he expects way too much for a lower level econ class Smart guy extremely harsh grader very high standards 
Very harsh grader for a lower level economics class I am very interested in economic development but if anything the class made me dislike the subject While he seemed like an intelligent person Professor Dapice seemed to not have time for his Tufts classes and seemed to dislike some students for no apparent reason Would not recommend 
ProfDapice is an extremely nice and humorous guy He is someone who works in the real world and understand how things really work Hes not treating his class as an introduction class for sure because he expects you to do lots of work But once youve done your work go to his office hour youd find how brilliant he really is 
PARTICIPATION MATTERS 
Wonderful lecturer and person He has so much experience which is so valuable and essential to the subject You have to participate and research your country before class in order to get the most out of it He really wants discussion and the class thrives on it Overall a great experience made me want to go into the development field 
A nice and smart guy but his lecture is harder to understand than the notes he posted His notes are not as helpful as other teachers slides Not the best choice of ES  
ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Viesca is a great guy ES was a hard class and you absolutely have to do the homework but he ends up curving the class generously Hes pretty awkward but fun to joke around with He is very accessible outside of class and great one on one He is very smart and sometimes gets wrapped up with proofs in class but just ask questions and hell explain 
Viesca is a little hesitant when teaching but he covers all of the material pretty thoroughly He does a bit too much derivation for my taste but he always works out inclass examples of problems 
I LOVED his climate change engineering class It was a lot of work but the labs were fun and I was interested in the material Durant is slightly awkward to begin with but he was super funny by the end of the semester and always very helpful

John is hoot and a half Seriously super entertaining dry humor He had some unrealistic standards but he is flexible in the end The class was informative and the labs were interesting and engaging He is an easy grader and wants his students to succeed Sometimes the lectures were a snooze though Overall a good class and good professor 
A good advisor and cares about his students 
I had him for an elective class about renewable energy It was a lot harder than anyone anticipated and yet I dont feel as though I learned all that much 
Honestly if I were to have rated him in the beginning of the semester he would have gotten all s from me But after its all said and done no matter how frustrated I may have been in the beginning he really is a great teacher and taught me a ton about writing Aside from writing  papers there isnt really other homework so its not that hard 
The class itself isnt bad he just grades really low and you dont really know what hes looking for He also doesnt tell you your grades unless you ask because he knows youre going to freak out and cry 
I have hardly ever had a thorough sense of exactly what Bosch was looking for in my assignment He withholds from giving students their grades unless they request them which is intimidating Classes are sometimes interesting and got better as the semester went on Stresses clarity development and conciseness in writing 
He is very nice but I am never left knowing exactly what it is that is expected of me in my assignments He looks for a distinct type of writing and he is hard to please He does not tell you your grades unless you meet and ask him which is intimidating The class became more interesting and less overwhelming as the semester went on 
He is unclear at times about what he wants exactly but he is passionate about what he is teaching There is a lot of work but most of the assignments work toward the next paper that is due Ignoring the difficulty he definitely improved my writing Put in the work and attempt to act interestedparticipate in class and you will do fine 
The class itself was not too hard if you write what Prof Bosch wants to read The class was however based solely around art analysis so it felt as though I was in an art appreciation class instead of an english writing class 
Pretty cool teacher He definitely is engaged and passionate and really works to help the students succeed However this is a challenging class so you will have to really work to improve your writing and sometimes his assistance is vague If youve had experience in analyzing images like paintings youre in luck 
I like him I think he improved my writing a lot and he is a nice guy All our essays are based off of paintings instead of books so this is a good class for someone who doesnt want to read a lot and really focus on their writing He provides helpful comments on your rough drafts so you know what to fix for your final Hes good 
TOUGH GRADER 
Professor Bosch is passionate about what he teaches and tries to make his class more interesting than a typical english class That being said he is a harsh grader and is impossible to please He is unclear with what he wants its often frustrating when you think youre doing something right then find out its wrong Bosch isnt bad just hard 
He is a horrible professor He has no idea how to teach physics he doesnt not really know the subject himself He makes mistakes on tests and is too stubborn to look at them when you submit them for regrade He doesnt like to help students Many people take physics  despite the fact that its harder just cause Tobin is better than Guertin 
not very helpful at all 
Prof Guertin gets a really bad rap For students who are motivated and work hard he shows a great deal of concern regarding their progress and is genuinely happy when his students do well His problem sets are indicative of his exam problems and you will do well if you make the effort 
Worst Professor at Tufts He is unclear frequently makes mistakes during class and shows absolutely no interest in the success of his students He has no business teaching at institution like Tufts 
Booooooooooooooring 
he doesnt really even teach anything class is useless for the most part 
Professor was very caring and funny Class was interesting and tests were hard but fair 
He is a bit impatient with students and doesnt make concepts clear He also give VERY little time on tests 
Worst instructor that I had while at Tufts Lectures are incomprehensible and he is often confused unprepared or distracted He spends way more time adding noises and flying shapes to his PowerPoint presentations than he does teaching Take Physics  instead 
I took PhD level BioOrganic Chemistry at my alma mater as in undergrad a top  ranked National University US News receiving As in Organic Chemistry and BioOrganic Chemistry With this experience in mind I must say that while the lectures are interesting the exams for his class are absolute garbage Nit picky 
Schaffhausen teaches graduate biochem and this is certainly a touch graduate level course The course is based a lot on experiments and is therefore tough to follow at times Overall he just really wants people to understand biochem I like the course but had to work really hard for the grade I got test averages are in the s 
Horrible in every way 
tough class but youll learn a ton 
AWFUL LECTURES He didnt even bother to put lecture slides like ever other professor does weeks in advance until AFTER the lecture Lectures were extremely disorganized 
Denby has a brilliant grasp of the topics he teaches in this course which is structured effectively He explains the ideas with exceptional clarity and also consistently understands discussion from the class however well or poorly it is articulated by a student He corrects witout being unfriendly It was an ideal introductory philosophy course

Denby was a real gem who actively tried to get to know us as students and make philosophy interesting for us Even though I cant tell you anything about philosophy today and definitely faked it until I made it with the papers he assigned he acknowledged that I was trying and I still received very good grades 
Amazing amazing professor Denby is witty funny and extremely personal For an intro phil class took for eng  I learned so much about analyzing arguments Provides you with all info needed to complete papers and allows you to pretty much write on whatever has been discussed in class Highly recommend dont miss out taking a class with Denby

Denby is a brilliant witty and fun professor He really knows the content and actively tries to get students to participate Asks interesting questions Papers are graded for phil concepts not  paragraph essay form Metaphysics is tedious but it was a great class and I wish I could take more with him Go to lecture Easy grader 
This class is rather boring It focuses completely on moral theories which is rather dry Prof Denby however is a great teacher He is funny and covers the material very well Some of the theories can be complicated but he was very clear and helpful I enjoyed him but not the class 
A great guy but sometimes seems as if hes lecturing for his own benefit This class has definitely gotten better with time though finally becoming more discussion less lecture Overall a good professor 
deudes freakin awesome and his lazy eye has magic philosophical powers 
Excellent class well presented and effective workload 
good overall teacher his classes are usually the whole grade based on  papers this is good in some ways but I had a a hard time with the first one it would have been better to have some more guidance but he really covers the material well if you can stay interested in class

Denby is a great lecturer Pay extra attention to the outlines he provides on Trunk as they will help with notes organization Take LOTS of notes and you will have all the info for the papers which are the ONLY grades  or  If you arent interested in the subject matter you will get a little bored

You dont have to like philosophy to take Denbys classes his enthusiasm lights up the most boring of subjects Lots of discussion for a large lecture class and most of it is interesting The papers are easy and the class is clearly organized Watch out for Denbys morbid sense of humor though  it will come up when you least expect it

SO MANY PAPERS 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
Respected in his field and gives interesting lectures for those interested in the energy industry 
Metcalf Rock Best Micro Prof ever Just go to him with questions Hes got the answer Problem set were a little to hard 
 Care about his own research and publications much more than care about student Guidance to student is limited to those who commit to academic  Exams usually are harder than HW to differentiate students which is not a problem However he did not give students enough training to enhance that ability to facing that gap on a daily basis 
Do NOT bother with this guy I did alright in his class but he is a hard grader Shows little interest in his students and is kind of a mean guy No emotion when he lectures lectures are disorganized despite following the same structure as the infinitely more understandable book Youd be better off in someone elses class Try Fennollosasp 
LECTURE HEAVY 
TOUGH GRADER 
Clearly only cares about his research His grading parameters are unclear Hes disorganized in lecture and in the structure of the class constantly changing things His examples were frequently wrong or couldnt be explained well Thinks too highly of himself and grades super subjectively 
Not fair at all he grades too subjectively 
One of the best professors Ive ever had 
Good professor but dont take Historical Marxism It is a waste of time and the material could be taught in half a semester 
Really knows the material but he takes some time getting used to The lectures are punctuated with side notes and personal stories that keep it interesting The work load and essay assignments are always reasonable and fair 
Lectures can be somewhat boring but he does try to keep it interesting Really helpful if you go to his office hours Grades pretty easily 
Absolutely awful Thinks that a B is a great grade Impossible to listen to when he speaks as he never provides reference dates or reminds who he is talking about DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS You will regret it 
He constantly brings up the amputation of his right foot guys if im right he will not shut up about loosing in a snow blower of all the ways to loose your foot come on But he tries to make it more dramatic by relating his foot loss ha in past historical wars Other than that hes a good professor Hope that helps 
Definately one of the best teachers at Tufts Dont be put off by his sometimesrough manner He is incredibly adept at making dry material interesting 
Dull class hard to pay attention to what hes saying because he speaks in a monotone If you can listen he tells some interesting stories Also it was hard to pay attention because there was absolutely no class participation just him talking for the whole period 
For Early and Imperial Russia in Spring  The guy is clearly brilliant but seriously oldschool photocopies blackboards tweed jackets and everything Some of his stories helped to make lectures interesting and he is quite eloquent but I often needed the reading during class to keep track Even then I felt discombobulated 
good guy 
His lectures are dry and there is almost no class involvement He cares a lot about his class but is not helpful at all and grades quite subjectively His papers show little to no comments on them He does not communicate his expectations effectively 
Mulholland is a bit dull at times but overall is a very wellversed knowledgable professor The class is very interesting and is not too hard to do well in I definitely learned more in this class than at most in Tufts Although he encourages virtually no class discussion he is great to go talk to during office hours 
Fun guy good teacher Made class intersesting  let students lead discussion but never allowed those uncomfortable silences Funny guy laidback style 
Beyond brilliant this guy is a genius with an approachable manner genuine interest in history and students the best this school has had to offer in several generations My dad warned me not to miss ANY of his courses My dads only good insight 
Incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiasticall lecture Helpful if you seek him out in office hours 
Loved his Modern Russian history class He provided a great outview of Russian history  and I encourage all to take his class 
Modern Russia class was boring just him lecturing the whole time Biased and not tolerant of opposing views even if backed up Avoid 
Amazing teacher with a vast array of knowledge on seemingly every topic May appear dull and uninterested buy he is one of very few genuinely brillant professors at Tufts Just by listening to him speak you will gain more than you ever imagined

Taliaferro is a decent professor He can be intimidating but is not a bad guy as long as you dont bother him or ask stupid questions Very knowledgeable about the subject matter but Intro to IR is VERY CHALLENGING with him If you study and do the work though it is definitely possible though not likely to get an A Overall not a bad class 
this class was ridiculously difficult taliaferros got a big ego and its apparent through the unidentifiable large words he uses during lecture which makes it almost impossible to take notes good luck 
Unclear lectures rambling style definitely do not take his class 
Excellent lecturer Engaging tried to be funny Sure he was tough and a bit of an ass but you will learn A LOT Very enthuisiastic about his own opinons within the course material Expectations are very clear he is very helpful take the class 
The absolute worst quotprofessorquot I have ever had at Tufts in my  yrs as a undergrad student Incompetent unpredictable vindictive arbitrary in grading highly intolerant to views other than his own Totally freelances his lectures with a condescending tone Unfortunate that this individual received tenure Avoid avoid avoid at all costs 
very clear and well organized I find Prof T to be very helpful and careing about his students But you have to work hard in his class 
I am very intersted in international relations but did not like TaliaferroHe seems aggressively disinterested in the progress of his students and encourages them NOT to seek him out outside of classI usually had no idea what was going on in class ended up skipping a lot of lectures because the ones I did attend were torture but didnt do poorly 
For Intro to IR let it be known that this class is SUPER theorybased If you dont enjoy theory wait for a different prof That being said you will learn a ton Unfortunately Taliaferro and the TAs really only look for spitback essays are strictly lecture and readingbased Not much innovation here 
Horrible professor Worst I have had at Tufts He is so arrogant and unhelpful that he shouldnt be teaching at all 
talks like a tool but he can be wicked helpfull in office hours 
Professor Taliaferro is one of the best professors Ive had at Tufts He is extremely knowledgeable about WWII down to obscenely obscure detail He will know if you have not done the readings so do them It is however nearly impossible to get an A or A in his class That being said it is still worth having him He can also be funny at times 
horrible could he be more arrogant lectures like a tape recorder wont stop and doesnt take questions ridiculously hard take PS wMufti 
I was so interested in the topic of the class but professor Taliaferro made me dread it While his lectures are clear he looks down upon participation and makes anyone who asks a question feel stupid He is demeaning and patronizing when you meet with him oneonone His exams are graded ridiculously He is the reason tenure should not exist 
Taliaferro is very arrogant causing many students to dislike him However he is an excellent lecturer and does a great job introducing topics in IR for all types of learners It is nearly impossible to get higher than a B and B Lots of reading for each class takehome midterm and final one  pg research paper graded in different sections 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
He is very knowledgeable but is incredibly pompous and disrespectful towards the students 
Taliaferro takes some getting used to no doubt about it He does his best to make himself as unlikable as possible However his lectures are very clear and if youre driven and get a decent TA youll do just fine In the end youll feel proud of yourself for having conquered his class 
arrogant and anal compulsive doesnt seem to like his students at all wholly unapproachable but very knowledgable

Felt more accomplished getting an A in his class than I did when I actually got into Tufts A hard grader but extremely clear about what he wants out of assignmentsfollow instructions to the letter and youll be fine I also had him for PS and he was fine but he really shines in upperlevel courses where he can interact more with students 
smug and arrogant was not helpful at all as a teacher and alleged I was trying to get him to do my paper when I asked for clarification a blemish on the Universities Political Science department has no sense of humor and is prone to extreme mood swings interesting material but too bad the message lacks any polish 
Though tough and merciless Taliaferro is a very knowledgeable professor and Ive learned a lot from him Contrary to public opinion I think hes fairly friendly and approachable Hes got kindof a twisted sense of humor but it works Take one of his classes if youre not afraid of a challenge 
Very knowledgeable professor and he tells you exactly what he wants and how he wants it Very straight forward but holds a high standard for student work 
Taliaferro is a horrible lecturer he speaks too fast and i find it quite hard to keep up and he does not like repeating things his tests are not too bad but he is not helpful at all he is quite arrogant and his TAs are useless 
Worst professor in the history of academia 
His class is a mixture of sharp clarity and heaps of vagueness which I suppose is due to the rather unorganized nature of the subject Tells his TAs to grade very harshly and meeting for recitation was a bore Also its a PowerPoint class He taught me the most important thing Ive learned so far at Tufts though I am SO not an IR major

On the one hand the most interesting Political Science Professor at Tufts who will legitimately exponentially increase your knowledge of National Security On the other hand he is the most brutal grader in existence essentially unwilling to give an A 
Taliaferro is a brilliant guy His lectures are very clearly laid out and it is easy to follow him He moves at a very quick pace in the course readings which is challenging but his class is well worth the difficulty Hes got a wierd personality but if you get to know him you will like him 
prof taliaferro knows his stuff better than almost any other professor ive ever had you will learn a lot from any of his classes however he is possibly the toughest grader ive ever had and he tends to overly scrutinize and nitpick your assignments dont write a paper about germany or japan 
Not too polished on the people skills but he does know his stuff 
Jeff comes off as intimidating at first but this class is definitely worth taking He is very good at lecturing and you will learn a lot from this class 
Gives no productive feedback Demotivating Class is hard but bearable Didnt think he was so bad until he was condescending during the research paper process If you take the class make sure you have a good TA They can make or break your IR experience 
Very condescending in class and doesnt give out as Do not take this class with him 
Yeah he was a bit arrogant but it was completely harmless I thought it was a waste of time when hed drift off into talking about what shows he doesnt watch on TV but you dont HAVE to go to class he puts all his slides on blackboard It does help to have a good TA Youll do fine on the tough papers but dont expect a miracle 
His lectures are very clear and well organized Everything is graded by the TAs so it really helps to go to recitations and turn everything in on time 
Hes very set in his own ideas and beliefs and isnt too openminded to opposing ideas but you will definitely learn a LOT about International Relations theory 
very intelligent knows his stuff and makes sure that you know he knows everything EVERYTHING hes always right but the intro class is very well structured and expectations are quite clear 
One of the best classes Ive taken at Tufts Youll enjoy it most if youre a realist with prior experience in security studies

SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS

Taliaferro thinks hes a standup comedian  a very cheezy one He creates really useful lecture slides and tends to cover the readings in those lectures He is VERY pretentious and harsh on students when they ask questions he actually discourages questions sometimes He is an incredibly harsh grader and tells his TAs to almost never give out As 
Obstinate selfcentered and pompous Yes Will you get an Aor an A No Will you be forced to learn more in one semester than any other intro class Yes 
way too difficult for an intro class 
Do not take this class with this professor Though he is clearly very smart and his lectures are informative he is the most conceited professor Ive ever had I lost interest in IR after taking this class and advise all to take PS in the spring Unless this class occupies your entire life it is close to impossible to receive an A or A grade 
Kind of a cross between Fresh Princes Jeffrey and Carlton Hes a great lecturer but the class is hard and I wouldnt expect much sympathy 
Came in after reading reviews and thought he would be rather uninteresting and unsympathetic towards students Pleasantly surprised Hes a great orator and attempts to lighten up the theory and lectureheavy material with jokes about horrible modern TV and movies his cats and occasional scandalous stories about royal European families 
I had a good experience The class isnt easy but hes a great lecturer and very helpful if you visit him during office hours and follow his policies I met with him twice at critical stages in my research paper and it really helped me pull off a high grade on it You may or may not quotlikequot him but dont let that scare you off 
I did all the readings for Tals midterm and did not do very well I did no readings for the final and did much much better Grading is not objective in this class no matter how specific the rubrics are You will learn a lot but you wont get an A or an A Plain and simple

TOUGH GRADER 
Prof Taliaferro is a very clear lecturer who relies heavily on slides all posted on Trunk but adds something of his own to the material He is very prepared on the subject and has held extremely interesting real world positions although his classes are far from inspirational 
This class is intense but well worth it Taliaferro knows his stuff and is very helpful if you go to his office hours People that complain are lazy and just werent willing to do the work for the class We call them qual econ majors 
Hes an engaging lecturer but class attendance isnt mandatory Slides are online and I havent done any of the readings since Thucydides his slides cover them well Not very approachable outside of class having gone to office hours and attempting to talk to him His arrogance is insufferable 
his lectures are clear which is the only good thing i can say about him i had a question and when the TA couldnt answer it she suggested i go to his office hours i went he went on a  minute rant about how he was too busy to answer my question or help me thanks taliaferro since im sure youre youre reading this instead of helping student 
I learned so much from this class and Taliaferro is incredibly informed on all things IR and unafraid to correct your mistakes Revise the paper as he suggests do the reading and follow his technical instructions on the syllabus and youll do fine 
Everybody keeps saying that Prof Taliaferro is arrogant etc At first he might seem but it is not true Obviously he sets high standards because he knows we can do it If you just want to cruise around go do math for social choice He is available outside class and you learn from him more than from any other Prof He deserves praise Number  
He thinks hes the smartest person on the planet and its really annoying The class is interesting though 
He knows his stuff and youll learn a lot but the class is unecessarily difficult and he is really annoying and not engaging at alldont expect much 
If you want to learn a ton and still not do well take this class Taliaferro is an extremely smart man but he does not give As or As and a B is difficult give individual help or even claim to enjoy teaching his class He actually admits to caring more about his research Really a shame that hes such a jerk because I did learn a lot 
Sure I learned something  but thats because I studied The guy does not teach He reads from a prepared lecture that sounds more like an overblown grandiloquent hairball of  spit out by one of his grotesque cats Am I bitter Perhaps

HILARIOUS 
Think you got skates You cannot skate with Jeff Taliferro will kick your ass if you blink Hes a brilliant man with strong opinions and extremely specific grading policies and procedures that he rarely departs from However you will learn a lot Especially if you like security studies If you mentally prepare for the worst youll be fine 
If you take a class other than intro to IR with Taliaferro youll find hes actually very personable and willing to help you His lectures are really engaging and he gives clear detailed guiedlines for assignments In his upper level PS courses there is usually a semesterlong  page original research paper instead of a midtermfinal 
Intense man but thats what you need for an intro class like this Dont expect much better than A at best very few A he likes being right 
TOUGH GRADER 
GET READY TO READ 
Taliaferro can be described as a bit pretentious at least in this intro class and a tough grader He occasionally berates questioners so if youre going to ask a question make sure its well thought out In this class most people get a B or a C but you most likely wont fail if you pay attention Getting an A is rare but not impossible 
Just do yourself a favor and take the class with someone else No one gets an A 
GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK 
CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA 
TOUGH GRADER 
Took PS in  Thoughts Somewhat of a mercurial temper Not angry per se but can be very terse Very clear guidelines for projects Good feedback given on essays In lieu of any midterms or finals we were expected to complete a shortanswer test with an essay component and write two takehome essays Grading is tough but fair 
This class is a lot of work but well worth it learning aplenty Taliaferro can be pompous but is generally amusing and has excellently prepared lectures Gets visibly annoyed when kids try to show off in class Knows his stuff  tries to get to know everyone

CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA 
Professor Taliaferro is a leading scholar in his field and he is extremely knowledgeable His lectures are very clear and easy to follow Reading assignments usually align well with his lectures so Id highly encourage you to the readings As long as you study the lecture presentation slides and pay attention in class you will be fine 
Taliaferro is one of the better profs around Anyone who says otherwise didnt put any time into his class and never went to his office hours Hes all business can and will answer any question if you have the balls to ask This class is a staple of a Tufts education 
hes brilliant though often hard to understand in lecture breezing over things he thinks should be clear to everyone whos not an IR scholar the readings intimidating and long but do itits helpful and reinforces the ideas the exams were hard but doable youll learn so much in this class 
Ill give you one thing he lectures very well However its not him that grades the stuff its the TAs So if you have an easy TA relax If you have a TA like mine whose name I should not say but I will anyway Roham Alvandi then get another one

I took his course on Poe Hawthorne and Melville and though I thought the material was interesting I found that class discussions were really not useful These are dense ideaheavy works but Prof Wolff doesnt guide classes in the thoughtful philosophical direction these authors demand I was motivated solely by my love of the authors

Nate Wolff is awesome His classes are a good mix of lectures and student discussion and his lectures are always funny and enlightening I took his Poe Hawthorne and Melville class so there was a lot of reading but as long as you do the readings thoughtfully youll get a good grade as he is not a tough grader Awkward but approachable

INSPIRATIONAL 
GET READY TO READ 
A great professor even though the writers he teaches can be pretty boring His lectures are illuminating and fascinating and he has a perfect mix of lecture and conversation You definitely feel like hes giving you what you need to know but also letting students participate even in a big class Also just a very kind human 
Lectures get kind of boring and he isnt very clear on what he teaches His grading is also very arbitrary especially on the research paper Tests themselves arent too challenging Midterm was basically a rehash of Statistics and final is mostly theory based with very little math One of those put in the effort and youll be fine classes 
Not a very clear lecturer For people with exposure to the subject it was fine but coming in from  with no other experience his class was difficult to followand it didnt help that it was extremely disorganized Projects werent too hard but also werent particularly interesting Id recommend taking  with someone else 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Nice guy and takes you seriously if you meet him in person HOWEVER his lectures are extremely dry and  of the time unhelpful People actually benefit more by teaching themselves because I can only recall two instances where Guyers lectures actually helped me Still take COMP though because it is challenging and fun 
GET READY TO READ 
Class can be a hit or a miss Usually has little to do with how to solve the assignments A lot of conceptual material for understanding how languages work Guyer is nice and tries to help when asked Hes fun but the material isnt Weekly assignments that you must start on time Unfortunately no tokens Midterm isnt bad Uses Ramseys Textbook 
The professor are not willing spend time on explanation The assignments are cut  out of  As a result the class make no sense although it cost a semester If you want to learn something you can just help yourself 
The chillest guy Good Guy Guyer Really helpful and super friendly always answers emails and is available to meet during or outside office hours Also really easy extended every deadline and made tricky parts optional Also listens to feedback from students and is very responsive 
GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
Would not take this class ever again Material was extremely difficult and not taught well in class Interesting that for a computer programming class the exams were on paper Hw and projects would take so many hours to complete and were hard to do based off of what was taught in class A lot of self teaching had to be done did not learn anything 
TOUGH GRADER 
SKIP CLASS YOU WONT PASS 
I took comp  in the fall of  While its true that the class was a mess due to factors outside of his control Guyer put in minimal effort as the professor rather than stepping up to make a bad situation better Lecture was unhelpful TAs came and went as they pleased assignment expectations were unclear study resources were nonexistent 
Guyer is a great professor that really knows his stuff and makes it interesting to learn However at least for Comp expect to wait forever to get assignments graded and expect the specifications to change every ten minutes Nonetheless it was a very enjoyable class to have with Guyer 
GET READY TO READ 
LOTS OF HOMEWORK 
A am timeblock encouraged the majority of students to skip class the disappearance of most grading TAs led to  of  assignments being returned before the end of school and those issues alongside the fact that tests and hw are unrelated to each other led to Guyer having a very tough semester However I feel most of this was out of his control 
Sam is a great professor knows his stuff and is extremely accessible The class is great he draws lots of pictures and uses helpful metaphors Plus hes a really cool guy 
I think Guyer is a pretty cool guy eh teaches computers and doesnt afraid of anything For real though hes really nice and informative in class with completely reasonable amounts of homework project etc 
He knows what hes talking about but if you dont have extensive experience abroad or interest in becoming a human rights activist youre clearly not his equal At least thats what he thinks 
Very good professor every lecture is wellorganized and clearly presented smith takes an interest in each of his students and encourages participation but doesnt force it from everyone His class is never boring and you will learn a lot 
ProfSmith is a very nice professor who likes to spend time with his students Though hes a bit arrogant in making his argument hes willing to give you his reason Hes a big name in his field so you shouldnt expect him to be very neutral Hes not an easy grader 
Do yourself a favor an stay away from Smith Even if the class sounds interesting he will find a way to ruin it Incredibly full of himself and hardly ever encourages class discussion or people to share their view points On top of everything he is a really hard grader and gives little constructive feedback 
TOUGH GRADER 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Worst class experience Ive had Deceptively approachable No help is given if you want help in class or feedback on your papers even after they have been graded Offensively arrogant Confusing Stream of consciousness questions that were changed a week before the deadline Still did well overall but its really hard to know what he even wants

This class has  papers the third of which is your final Prof Smith constantly changes the topics of the papers up until the week before writing them The prompts are typically  to  page long making them almost and convoluted as his lectures The readings are long and inane and the feedback he gives on his papers is borderline offensive 
best professor at Tufts hands down

TOUGH GRADER 
The lectures were long and there was a lot of readings assigned He is very vague on what he wants from you as far as the papers go There were no tests but he was a very hard grader on the writing assignments Also he takes forever to grade I had no idea how I did in the class until it was long over He never graded anything until the end

Alnoor is definitely interesting His lectures feel long for sure Not many people did the readings so for discussions it was usually one or two people or himself answering every question Hes sorta funny at times but thats only if you manage to hear him Hes not very timely with getting assignments graded and returned 
He thinks hes cool but he really just a tool he likes to have us call him cornbread Id take him ever semester tho he likes to talk about softball he continually says chicks dig the long ball

Visiting professor early Americanist Knowledgeable but class is mainly teachityourself by reading  pages per class At times he can be rude either not answering questions because this is a survey course or just walking away while youre talking to him Assignments are extremely ambiguous but they are very easily graded 
Hague is a quirky teacher but he knows his material decently well Many awkward silences in class He tends to make little mistakes and makes a big deal repeatedly tells students to watch out for silly arithmetic errors out of it possibly out of embarrassment Low level of class participation As long as you have questions hell answer them 
Chuck Hague is a genuine math nerd Nervous in front of people strangely shaped but earnest he can be confusing but is honestly involved with students and material On day one start counting the number of different pairs of shoes he wearsowns 
Math  wasnt bad sometimes it was hard to follow but I think it was more the material than the teacher 
Chuck wears many layers and always takes a sweater off during class after tucking in the shirt underneath Yeah hes awkward Nonetheless he makes even linear algebra semientertaining and explains the subject relatively well Exams were fair Did I mention hes pretty awkward 
Do not take a class with this professor He is one of the worst teachers I have ever had 
Mr Hague is great He always makes sure you understand what youre doing Hes a little quirky but we love him for it it just makes class that much more interesting 
Hes a cool and funny guy unfortunately Precalc is a hard subject which isnt fun to teach or learn He is a good and helpful professor although he is kinda odd at timeshe makes up for it with his humor or sarcasm Really enjoyed his class although I didnt do well and hate precalc 
Decent teacher but sometimes confuses himself during class Its sometimes difficult to keep up with his notes on the board Hes not the best professor for this class but he is really nice and tries to help students as best as possible 
I counted  pairs of shoes Theyre mostly pumas and theyre all fashionable This professor is extremely down to earth which is a good alternative to other slightly snobby teachers Ive had He really cares about making his students understand the material and is super nice Hes great 
One of the worst professors Ive ever had Hes a personable guy who has no business teaching a class Takes  minutes to answer the most basic question and even then leaves you confused Very arrogant and flamboyant No credibility makes lectures pointless Important to get good TA bc theres a lot of reading although interesting Avoid him 
Eichenberg is awesome Extremely engaging good sense of humor helpful interesting lectures He really wants each of his students to understand the material There is a ton of reading for this class but its worth it considering everything you learn if you put the effort in and Eichenberg is extremely helpful

GRADED BY FEW THINGS 
LECTURE HEAVY 
Truly a good personreally cares about his students and is always willing to make accommodations for you if youre struggling Knows his stuff when it comes to political polls and polling methods Readings definitely optional but know his slideshows inside outthe exams are hard and make up most of your grade 
My favorite professor at Tufts I am writing this six years after graduating and I can say that no other professor had as much of an influence on my intellect than he did Very approachable seems to really like teaching I hope hes stopped smokin fags cuz I want him to live a long life 
I had him for PS  He is a really nice guy and a great professor His powerpoints are not very organized so make sure to write down notes His tests are very easy you dont even need to do all the readings Take his class Dont be discouraged from the readings because the readings are not necessary to do good in the class 
Eichenberg definitely cares about students progress and he is not out there to fail anyone Heavy use of assigned readings and lecture is important to attend Intro IR with him was a good class 
Very biasedquotCalifornia Im grateful for Texas Im not so surequot Cocky  He teaches IR pretty well but always interjects bias Unless you loved Kerry stay away far away 
Eichenberg is an amazing teacher He takes the time to learn names and engages almost every single student in the class Extremely interesting readings and class discussions and he is so so helpful in office hours Take one class with Eichenberg for sure 
I think he may be better in lecture classes Very interesting person who knows a great deal but also very verbose Focused on teaching underclassmen how to write good research papers Gives excellent direction 
Nice guy clear lectures but if you want an in depth and interesting course you should take it with someone else Far too superficial and some of his analysis is simply poor 
It was definitely an interesting class Plenty of reading to do but not all of it was tested on the exams Pay attention to lectures Its pretty much up to the TA when it comes to grading Still the prof was nice and entertaining to keep the class focused The prof wants the students to do well and even makes an effort to remember names 
Probably one of the most caring passionate professors out there truly interested and dedicated to his work and the students 
Eichenberg is a good lecturer and cares about his students PS was interesting and assessments were fair but you need to go to class and do all of the readings And he loves to let class out early 
Prof Eichenburg was a really engaging and smart professor The first IR unit is hell if you want to do all the reading which you should but its all very interesting He is very approachable and also brilliant He often ties class material to current events and encourages risk taking quotoriginalityquot in assignments Highly recommended 
Such a helpful and great guy Really cares about his students and wants them to do well Is so smart articulate and entertaining An incredible person 
Eichenberg is the man No to most people the coursework wont be too interesting Its a lot of theory for the first half of the course but he makes it as interesting as it could possibly be Hes all around a nice guy and clearly knows his stuff He genuinely doesnt want you to fail and will be very upfront about what he expects from you 
I was skeptical about Eichenberg prior to taking PS because I thought he was just another big PS lecturer After taking his class I consider him one of the best professors at Tufts and one of my favorites His class will challenge you but hes extremely fair and is concerned about your learning Take this class You wont regret it

Amazing professor Incredibly articulate and engaging in lectures Truly cares about students progress Couldnt have asked for a better Intro to International Relations professor 
I like Ike Take this class with him He assigns a lot of reading but his lectures are absolutely fantastic and youll learn a lot from him He really made it seem like there werent  people in the room and actually made an effort to learn as many names as he could Overall great guy makes you work hard and makes an int class fascinating 
dont listen to anyone else  eichenberg was a really good teacher for such a humongous class I highly recomend taking intro with him 
Professor Eichenberg is a great professor Intro to IR is a class that lots of people have to take and although its not the most interesting taking it with him makes it more interesting than it would have otherwise been He is always willing to take questions and tries hard to make the class feel small by learning namesdespite the large size 
He talks really fast be prepared for some speed listening and notetaking 
Public Opinion and Foreign Policy is one of the best classes Ive taken Eichenberg is really invested in the class and youll learn a lot Reading is heavy and a MUST for exams but not necessarily for class discussion Fair grader and cares about his students 
Really funny nice professor Powerpoints are good makes all of the complex readings understandable If you study for his tests a lot they dont seem to be hard Id suggest him he kept me interested in what I found could be a boring subject

A lot of people loved his lecturing Im not an auditory learner by any means so I kind of zoned out for a lot of it His powerpoints are pretty overwhelming and can be confusing But when it comes time for the midterm and the final EVERYTHING you need to know is on the powerpoints so just study those in depth and make sure you do the readings 
public opinion and us foreign policy 
hard 
His lectures are clear and as entertaining as they can possibly be given the material Stick through the first half of the course the second half is far more interesting Hes the perfect professor because he actually know what he is talking about AND he can teach it Split up readings with friends and youll be fine 
Took PS  with him He is a really great professor and always manages to make his lectures entertaining There is a lot of reading but its manageable and not all of it needs to be done The grading depends more on your TA than the professor Just pay attention to his lectures 
This man is a joke Not only are his lectures very boring but they are uninformative He goes off at wild tangents during the lectures relies heavily on powerpoint does not prepare students for their exams Essentially he is an awful teacher He is very reluctant to meet with students and belittles them in office hours and lectures Unhelpful 
Eichenberg is solid  engaging informative and usually clear although hes better at explaining the material than his own ideas Intro to IR is overrated in difficulty  you will do a lot of reading but if you can handle  pagesweek an A is easily reachable If youre not into IR the material can be dry but if you are its a wet dream

Professor Eichenberg is absolutely amazing He is so kind and he made sure that we were focused on our learning instead of just grades while also pushing us to think more deeply about all of the topics covered Our class was entirely discussion based with short reflections and lots of readingtotally manageable and I learned SO much 
eichenberg himself is a pretty decent prof except for the fact that he cannot resist answering questions of those that talk for the sake of blabbing and i must say those ppl should be put to death for the welfare of the other  or so ppl in that class but anyways hes an awesome prof very knowledgeable a kindred spirit intro to IR itself is a pretty bad class 
great lecturer tries to make a  person class seem smaller by learning peoples names hard class  A LOT of reading midterm was tough but hes always available to meet with and help 
Ive taken three classes with Eichenberg while at Tufts and I just want to reinforce all the other positive reviews he has received here Eichenberg is exceptional He truly cares remembers your name even into senior year and is always always there if you need him Hes a good man and an excellent professor 
He is a very biased man and while i think his intentions are for a positive student learnign environment I felt out of place and behind in this class even though I did all of the readings He assumes too much in some areas and not enough in others Not recommend this class unless you are good at sucking up 
Very good lecturer Knows his stuff and is open to criticism Sometimes gets carried off topic by students or when hes not prepared Really tries hard to learn as many names as possible Very helpful if you make an effort to seek out assistance A lot of reading but you learn a lot Great Class 
Knowledgeable professor Lots of information to memorize but manageable Important to get a good and fair TA Decent lectures  sometimes boring but often not that bad 
eichenberg is a brilliant man very knowledgeable about IR and very straightforward about his material no tricks just pay attention in class and for your own sake do the reading easy B if u stay on top of ur work

ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS 
One of the kindest most accessible professors Ive met Despite his reputation on campus as one of the most respected professors he still cares deeply about teaching basic concepts of International Relations to beginners He is extremely accessible and helpful outside of class despite his busy schedule The definition of a good professor 
This mans a fool He specilizes in public opinion so his credentials are writing poll questions His theory analysis is shallow and he often contradicts himself He relies on elementary power points for his lectures and gets thrown off topic easily Also stalls a lot answering basic questions 
I mean like Intro to IR at Tufts is obvs no joke but hes pretty good Just do all your readingswell as many as you can And if youre interested in gender studies take his class

The class is really interesting once you get into the material but Eichenbergs PowerPoints are an absolute disaster If you didnt pay extremely close attention during class you are essentially going to have to DECODE this mans slides to study because he honestly just spews his thoughts onto them in a jumble of words Exams are not too hard
